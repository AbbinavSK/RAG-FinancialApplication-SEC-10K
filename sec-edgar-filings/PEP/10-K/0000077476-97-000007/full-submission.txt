          May 7, 1997
Annual Meeting of Shareholders
<PAGE>

                                    PART I
Item 1.    Business

      PepsiCo,  Inc. (the "Company") was  incorporated in Delaware in 1919 and
was  reincorporated  in North Carolina in 1986.  Unless the context  indicates
otherwise,  when used  herein the term  "PepsiCo"  shall mean the  Company and
its various  divisions and  subsidiaries.  PepsiCo is engaged in the following
businesses:  beverages,  snack foods and  restaurants.  In January,  1997, the
Company  announced  that it would  pursue  a plan to spin  off its  restaurant
businesses,  consisting  of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC, to  shareholders  as
an  independent  publicly  traded  company.  In 1996,  the Company  decided to
dispose of its non-core restaurant businesses.

Beverages

      PepsiCo's beverage business,  which operates as Pepsi-Cola  Company,  is
comprised  of two business  units:  Pepsi-Cola  North  America  ("PCNA"),  and
Pepsi-Cola Company International ("PCCI").

      PCNA  manufactures  and sells beverage  products,  primarily soft drinks
and soft drink  concentrates,  in the United  States  and  Canada.  PCNA sells
its  concentrates  to  licensed  bottlers   ("Pepsi-Cola   bottlers").   Under
appointments from PepsiCo, bottlers manufacture,  sell and distribute,  within
defined  territories,  soft  drinks and  syrups  bearing  trademarks  owned by
PepsiCo,  including  PEPSI-COLA,  DIET PEPSI,  MOUNTAIN DEW,  SLICE,  MUG, ALL
SPORT  and,  within  Canada,  7UP and DIET 7UP (the  foregoing  are  sometimes
referred to as "Pepsi-Cola  beverages").  The Pepsi/Lipton Tea Partnership,  a
joint  venture  of PCNA and  Lipton,  develops  and sells tea  concentrate  to
Pepsi-Cola  bottlers  and  develops  and markets  ready-to-drink  tea products
under the LIPTON  trademark.  Such  products  are  distributed  by  Pepsi-Cola
bottlers  throughout  the  United  States  and  Canada.   Pepsi-Cola  bottlers
distribute  single-serve  sizes of OCEAN SPRAY juice  products  throughout the
United States pursuant to a distribution  agreement.

      Pepsi-Cola  beverages  are  manufactured  in  approximately  175  plants
located   throughout   the   United   States   and   Canada.   PCNA   operates
approximately 65 plants,  and  manufactures,  sells and distributes  beverages
throughout   approximately   455   licensed   territories,    accounting   for
approximately  56% of the  Pepsi-Cola  beverages sold in the United States and
Canada.  Approximately  110 plants are  operated by  independent  licensees or
unconsolidated   affiliates,   which   manufacture,    sell   and   distribute
approximately  44% of the  Pepsi-Cola  beverages sold in the United States and
Canada.  PCNA has a  minority  interest  in 7 of these  licensees,  comprising
approximately 70  licensed territories.
 
      PCCI  manufactures  and sells beverage  products,  primarily soft drinks
and soft drink  concentrates,  outside  the United  States  and  Canada.  PCCI
sells  its  concentrates  to  Pepsi-Cola  bottlers.  Under  appointments  from
PepsiCo,   bottlers   manufacture,   sell  and   distribute,   within  defined
territories,  beverages bearing  PEPSI-COLA,  7UP, MIRINDA,  DIET PEPSI, PEPSI
MAX,   MOUNTAIN   DEW,   DIET  7UP  and  other   trademarks.   PCCI   operates
approximately  30  plants  bottling  PepsiCo  beverage  products.   There  are
approximately    560   plants    operated   by   independent    licensees   or
unconsolidated   affiliates,   bottling  PepsiCo's  beverage  products.  These
products are  available in 191 countries  and  territories  outside the United
States  and  Canada.   Principal   international  markets  include  Argentina,
Brazil, China, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom.
                                       

                                       2
<PAGE>

      PCNA and PCCI make  programs  available to assist  licensed  bottlers in
servicing markets,  expanding  operations and improving production methods and
facilities.   PCNA  and  PCCI  also  offer   assistance  to  bottlers  in  the
distribution,  advertising  and marketing of PepsiCo's  beverage  products and
offer  sales  assistance   through  special   merchandising   and  promotional
programs and by training  bottler  personnel.  PCNA and PCCI maintain  control
over the composition and quality of beverages sold under PepsiCo trademarks.

Snack Foods

      PepsiCo's snack food business,  which operates as The Frito-Lay Company,
is  comprised  of  Frito-Lay   North  America   ("Frito-Lay")   and  Frito-Lay
International ("FLI") (formerly known as PepsiCo Foods International).

      Frito-Lay  manufactures  and sells a varied  line of salty  snack  foods
throughout  the United  States and Canada,  including  LAY'S and RUFFLES brand
potato chips,  DORITOS and TOSTITOS  brand tortilla  chips,  FRITOS brand corn
chips,  CHEE.TOS brand cheese  flavored  snacks,  ROLD GOLD brand pretzels and
SUNCHIPS brand multigrain snacks.

      Frito-Lay's  products are transported from its  manufacturing  plants to
major distribution  centers,  principally by company-owned  trucks.  Frito-Lay
utilizes a  "store-door-delivery"  system,  whereby its  approximately  17,500
person  sales force  delivers  the snacks  directly to the store  shelf.  This
system  permits  Frito-Lay to work closely with  approximately  500,000 retail
trade  customers  weekly  and  to be  responsive  to  their  needs.  Frito-Lay
believes  this  form of  distribution  is a  valuable  marketing  tool  and is
essential for the proper distribution of products with a short shelf life.

      FLI's  products are available in 81 countries  outside the United States
and Canada through  company-owned  facilities and  unconsolidated  affiliates.
On most of the European  continent,  PepsiCo's snack food business consists of
Snack  Ventures  Europe,  a joint venture  between  PepsiCo and General Mills,
Inc.,  in which  PepsiCo  owns a 60%  interest.  FLI also  sells a variety  of
snack food  products  which  appeal to local  tastes  including,  for example,
WALKERS  snack  foods,  which  are sold in the  United  Kingdom,  WEDEL  sweet
snacks,  which  are sold in  Poland,  and  GAMESA  cookies  and  ALEGRO  sweet
snacks,  which are sold in Mexico. In addition,  RUFFLES,  CHEEoTOS,  DORITOS,
FRITOS and SUNCHIPS  salty snack foods have been  introduced to  international
markets.  Principal  international markets include Australia,  Brazil, France,
Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom.

     PepsiCo Restaurant Services Group ("PRSG"), a new unit formed in 1996 which
also includes the existing operations of PFS, PepsiCo's restaurant  distribution
operation,  is responsible for the  consolidation of many restaurant  activities
and furnishes food,  supplies,  equipment and services to  approximately  16,000
company-operated,   franchised  and  licensed  PIZZA  HUT,  TACO  BELL  and  KFC
restaurants  in the United  States,  Canada,  Mexico and Poland.  On January 23,
1997, the Company announced that it is exploring the possible sale of PFS.

COMPETITION

     All of PepsiCo's businesses are highly competitive. PepsiCo's beverages and
snack  foods  compete  in the  United  States and  internationally  with  widely
distributed  products of a number of major companies that have plants in many of
the areas  PepsiCo  serves,  as well as with private label soft drinks and snack
foods and with the  products  of local  and  regional  manufacturers.  PepsiCo's
restaurants  compete  in  the  United  States  and  internationally  with  other
restaurants,  restaurant chains, food outlets and home delivery operations. PRSG
competes in the United States and  internationally  with other food distribution
companies. For all of PepsiCo's industry segments, the main areas of competition
are price, quality and variety of products, and customer service.

EMPLOYEES

     At December 28, 1996,  PepsiCo  employed,  subject to seasonal  variations,
approximately   486,000  persons  (including   approximately  260,000  part-time
employees),  of whom  approximately  335,000  (including  approximately  200,000
part-time  employees) were employed within the United States.  PepsiCo  believes
that its relations with employees are generally good.

RAW MATERIALS AND OTHER SUPPLIES

     The principal  materials  used by PepsiCo in its  beverage,  snack food and
restaurant  businesses  are  corn  sweeteners,  sugar,  aspartame,   flavorings,
vegetable and essential oils,  potatoes,  corn,  flour,  tomato products,  pinto
beans, lettuce, cheese, butter, beef, pork and chicken products,  seasonings and
packaging materials.  Since PepsiCo relies on trucks to move and distribute many
of  its  products,  fuel  is  also  an  important  commodity.   PepsiCo  employs
specialists  to  secure  adequate  supplies  of many of these  items and has not
experienced any  significant  continuous  shortages.  Prices paid by PepsiCo for
such items are subject to fluctuation.  When prices increase, PepsiCo may or may
not pass on such increases to its customers. Generally, when PepsiCo has decided
to pass  along  price  increases,  it has  done  so  successfully.  There  is no
assurance that PepsiCo will be able to do so in the future.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS

     The conduct of PepsiCo's businesses,  and the production,  distribution and
use of many of its products,  are subject to various  federal laws,  such as the
Food,  Drug and  Cosmetic  Act, the  Occupational  Safety and Health Act and the
Americans  with  Disabilities  Act. The conduct of PepsiCo's  businesses is also
subject to state, local and foreign laws.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES

      PepsiCo  owns  numerous  valuable  trademarks  which  are  essential  to
PepsiCo's  worldwide  businesses,  including  PEPSI-COLA,  PEPSI,  DIET PEPSI,
PEPSI MAX,  MOUNTAIN  DEW,  SLICE,  MUG, ALL SPORT,  7UP and DIET 7UP (outside
the United States), MIRINDA,  FRITO-LAY,  LAY'S, DORITOS,  RUFFLES,  TOSTITOS,
FRITOS,  CHEE.TOS,  ROLD  GOLD,  SUNCHIPS,  SANTITAS,   SMARTFOOD,   SABRITAS,
WALKERS,  PIZZA HUT, TACO BELL,  KENTUCKY  FRIED  CHICKEN and KFC.  Trademarks
remain valid so long as they are used  properly for  identification  purposes,
and  PepsiCo   emphasizes   correct  use  of  its   trademarks.   PepsiCo  has
authorized  (through  licensing or franchise  arrangements) the use of many of
its  trademarks in such contexts as Pepsi-Cola  bottling  appointments,  snack
food joint ventures and  wholly-owned  operations and Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and
KFC  franchise  agreements.  In  addition,  PepsiCo  licenses  the  use of its
trademarks on collateral  products for the primary  purpose of enhancing brand
awareness.

      PepsiCo  either owns or has  licenses  to use a number of patents  which
relate to certain of its products and the processes for their  production  and
to the  design and  operation  of various  equipment  used in its  businesses.
Some of these patents are licensed to others.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

      PepsiCo expensed $115 million,  $96 million and $152 million on research
and development activities in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

      PepsiCo  continues to make expenditures in order to comply with federal,
state,   local  and  foreign   environmental   laws  and  regulations,   which
expenditures  have  not  been  material  with  respect  to  PepsiCo's  capital
expenditures, net income or competitive position.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

for  each of  PepsiCo's  industry  segments  and  major  geographic  areas  of
operations,  as well as capital  spending,  acquisitions  and  investments  in
unconsolidated    affiliates,    amortization   of   intangible   assets   and

contained in Item 8 "Financial  Statements and Supplementary  Data" in Note 19

      PepsiCo  is  subject to  various  claims  and  contingencies  related to
lawsuits,  taxes,  environmental  and other matters  arising out of the normal
course of  business.  Management  believes  that the  ultimate  liability,  if
any,  in excess of  amounts  already  provided  for,  is not  likely to have a
material   adverse  effect  on  PepsiCo's  annual  results  of  operations  or
financial condition.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

      Included on pages F-44 through F-50.

Item 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS
       AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

MANAGEMENT'S ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION
Management's  Analysis  is  presented  in four  sections.  The  first  section
provides  introductory  comments,  highlights items that significantly  impact
comparability   of  reported   financial   information   and   provides   some
perspective  of our  operations  outside of the United  States  (pages  10-13).
The  second  section   analyzes  the  results  of   operations,   first  on  a
consolidated  basis and then for each of our three  industry  segments  (pages
13-31).  The  final two  sections  address  our  consolidated  cash  flows and
financial  condition,  which also includes our  Cautionary  Statements  (pages
31-36).

                                       10
<PAGE>

      As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  we had
a two-for-one  stock split in 1996.  All share data in  Management's  Analysis
have been adjusted to reflect the stock split.

CHANGE IN SEGMENT REPORTING
Beginning  in the fourth  quarter of 1996,  we changed the  segment  reporting
which  supports  our  Management's  Analysis  to more  closely  reflect how we
manage the  business.  As a result,  our  beverages  and snack foods  segments
are now reported on a North American  basis (U.S. and Canada  combined) and an
International  basis (all other  international)  while the restaurants segment
continues  to be reported on a U.S. and  international  basis.  Also,  the net
sales and operating  profit we report  externally now generally  match the net
sales  and  operating   profit  our  operating  units  report  to  our  senior
management.  The operating  profit  reported on this  "Management  Basis" does
not reflect items the operating  units are not held  accountable  for, such as
the  $520  million   initial   impact  of  adopting   Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 121 (SFAS 121),  "Accounting  for the  Impairment of
Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of", in 1995 (see
Note 4). It also does not  reflect  insignificant  allocations  for  corporate
items  directly   attributable   to  the  segments  or  exclude  results  from
unconsolidated  affiliates,  both  of  which  are  required  by  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 14 (SFAS 14),  "Financial  Reporting for
Segments of a Business  Enterprise."  The Management  Basis  operating  profit
(page  19)  includes  a  reconciliation  to the  operating  profit  disclosure
required  by SFAS 14,  which is provided  in Note 19.  Prior year  amounts and
related management's analysis have been restated.

CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY
The  following  table  summarizes  items  impacting  comparability,  which are
described  in Notes 2, 13 and 15. We believe  the items  included in the first
section are so unusual  and  distortive  that we do not  include  them when we
evaluate the ongoing performances of our businesses.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES
Excluding  the  $576  million  of  unusual  impairment,   disposal  and  other
charges,   ongoing  international  operating  profit  (including  Canada),  as
measured  on  the  Management  Basis,  represented  10%,  24%  and  20% of our
consolidated  operating  profit  in 1996,  1995 and  1994,  respectively.  The
decline  in  1996  reflected  an  operating  loss in  International  beverages
compared  to an  operating  profit in 1995.  The 4% growth in 1995 was  slowed
by Mexico,  formerly our largest  international market, where the Mexican peso
devalued  approximately  50% in late  1994 and  early  1995.  Consumer  demand
declined  dramatically  in  response  to  declining  real  incomes,  increased
unemployment and price increases taken to offset rising costs.

Our efforts to  stimulate  demand,  reduce costs and reduce  capital  spending
resulted in only a modest  decline in peso  operating  profit.  However,  on a
U.S.  dollar  basis,  1995  sales,  income and  identifiable  assets in Mexico
declined  dramatically,  reflecting the unfavorable  translation effect of the
much weaker peso, as summarized below:

of  the  year-over-year   change  in  company-owned  Bottler  Case  Sales  and
concentrate  unit sales in  beverages,  pound or kilo sales in snack foods and

Worldwide  net sales rose $1.4  billion in 1996  reflecting  higher  effective
net  pricing  (including  the effect of product,  package and country  mix) in
each of our three  business  

                                       13
<PAGE>


segments and net volume gains of $592 million.  The higher effective net pricing
was  partially  offset  by an  unfavorable  foreign  currency  exchange  impact,
primarily  reflecting the weaker peso and the  strengthening  of the U.S. dollar
compared to the Japanese  yen.  The volume gains were driven by worldwide  snack
foods  and North  American  beverages,  partially  offset  by  declines  at U.S.
restaurants.  The sales  growth  rate was  reduced by 1 point as we reduced  our
ownership  of  the   restaurant   system  through   refranchising   and  closing
underperforming restaurants, as described in Management's Analysis - Restaurants
beginning on page 26.
     Worldwide net sales rose $1.9 billion or 7% in 1995. The  fifty-third  week
in 1994 reduced worldwide net sales growth by approximately 2 points. The growth
benefited from higher effective net pricing in International snack foods, driven
by Mexico,  and in North  American  beverages,  primarily to help offset  higher
prices for packaging.  These benefits were partially  offset by the  unfavorable
currency  translation  impact of the weaker peso on  International  snack foods.
Volume gains in worldwide  snack foods and  beverages  added $934 million to net
sales. Additional restaurant units contributed $623 million to sales growth.

COST OF SALES

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cost of  sales  as a  percent  of net  sales  decreased  .6 of a  point  in 1996
primarily due to lower raw materials costs in North American  beverages  coupled
with the leveraging effect of the higher effective net pricing.
     The .8 of a point  increase  in cost of sales as a percent  of net sales in
1995 was primarily due to higher packaging  prices in North American  beverages,
the effect of which was partially  mitigated by increased effective net pricing,
and an unfavorable mix shift in International beverages sales from higher-margin
concentrate to lower-margin packaged products. Cost of sales as a percent of net
sales in  International  snack  foods  increased  due to  inflation-driven  cost
increases in Mexico, which were partially mitigated by price increases.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A)

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SG&A  comprises  selling  and  distribution  expenses  (S&D),   advertising  and
marketing  expenses (A&M),  general and  administrative  expenses  (G&A),  other
income and expense and equity income or loss from investments in  unconsolidated
affiliates. In 1996, A&M,

                                       14
<PAGE>

S&D and G&A all grew faster than net sales driving a 9% increase in SG&A, led by
International  beverages.  Other income and expense included refranchising gains
in excess of the costs of closing other restaurants (net refranchising gains) of
$99  million,  compared  to $55  million in 1995.  In  addition,  1996  included
recurring  SFAS  121  noncash  impairment  charges  of $62  million  related  to
restaurants.  Losses from our unconsolidated affiliates,  compared to earnings a
year ago,  primarily  reflected our share of operating  losses from Buenos Aires
Embotelladora S.A. (BAESA). BAESA is one of our bottling joint ventures in Latin
America.
     In 1995,  SG&A grew 4% due to A&M, S&D and G&A all growing at a slower rate
than sales.  The slower  spending  was driven by  worldwide  beverages  and U.S.
restaurants.  G&A in  worldwide  beverages  benefited  from  International  cost
containment  initiatives,  savings  in  North  American  beverages  from  a 1994
reorganization  and leverage from the  increased  effective net pricing in North
American  beverages.  Other income benefited from net refranchising gains of $55
million,  compared to store  closure  costs of $10 million in 1994 and a gain on
the sale of an International bottling plant in 1995.

AMORTIZATION  OF  INTANGIBLE  ASSETS  declined  5% in 1996 to $301  million as a
result of the reduced  carrying  amount of intangible  assets in connection with
the 1995  adoption of SFAS 121 (see Note 4), but increased 1% to $316 million in
1995.  This  noncash  expense  reduced net income per share by $0.14 in 1996 and
$0.15 in 1995.

UNUSUAL  IMPAIRMENT,  DISPOSAL AND OTHER  CHARGES of $822 million  ($716 million
after-tax  or $0.45  per  share)  in 1996  were  associated  with  International
beverages  ($576  million)  and the  decision  to dispose of our  non-core  U.S.
restaurant businesses ($246 million). See Note 3.
     The 1995 charge of $520 million ($384 million after-tax or $0.24 per share)
was the initial,  noncash  impairment charge upon adoption of SFAS 121. See Note
4.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     In 1996, reported operating profit declined $441 million. Ongoing operating
profit  decreased $139 million,  primarily due to a combined  segment  operating
profit decrease of $95 million or 3%. The decline  reflected  increased costs in
excess of higher  effective  net pricing in  International  beverages  and North
American snack foods and unfavorable  currency  translation  impacts,  partially
offset by the $177  million  of  volume  gains.  Also  included  in the  segment
operating profit results were reduced  depreciation and amortization  expense of
$46 million as a result of the reduced  carrying  amount of assets in connection
with the  adoption of SFAS 121,  and $99 million of net  refranchising  gains in
1996 compared to $55 million in 1995, partially offset by the recurring SFAS 121
noncash  impairment  charge of $62  million in 1996.  Ongoing  operating  profit
growth was also hampered by increased net corporate costs.
     In 1995, reported operating profit declined $214 million. Ongoing operating
profit  increased $306 million or 10%. The fifty-third  week in 1994 reduced the
operating profit growth by approximately 2 points.  The profit growth was driven
by  combined  segment  operating  profit  growth of $283  million  or 8%,  which
reflected  volume growth of $283 million  ($430 million  excluding the impact of
the fifty-third  week) and $76 million due to net additional  restaurant  units.
These advances were partially  offset by net  unfavorable  currency  translation
impacts,  primarily  related to the peso.  The benefit of higher  effective  net
pricing  for all  segments  combined  was almost  entirely  offset by  increased
product and operating costs, primarily in Mexico, and higher packaging prices in
North American beverages. Ongoing operating profit growth benefited from reduced
net corporate costs.

GAIN ON STOCK  OFFERING  BY AN  UNCONSOLIDATED  AFFILIATE  of $18  million  ($17
million  after-tax  or $0.01 per  share) in 1994  related  to the  public  share
offering by BAESA. See Note 17.

Interest  expense,  net,  declined 10% in 1996 reflecting lower  international
debt levels and U.S. interest rates.
      Interest  expense,  net in 1995 was even with 1994,  reflecting  the net
impact of higher average interest rates offset by lower average borrowings.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our 1996  reported  effective tax rate  increased 9.9 points to 43.9%,  driven
by the low tax benefits associated with the unusual  impairment,  disposal and
other  charges.  Our 1996 ongoing  effective tax rate  increased 2.4 points to
35.0%,  primarily  reflecting  lower  benefits in 1996 from the  current  year
resolution  of certain  prior years audit issues and a decline in  lower-taxed
foreign  income  coupled  with an  increase  in  foreign  losses  with low tax
benefits.

      Our 1995  reported  effective tax rate  increased 1 point to 34.0%.  Our
1995 ongoing effective tax rate declined  slightly,  reflecting  benefits from
the  current  year  resolution  of certain  prior years  audit  issues.  These
benefits  were  partially  offset  by a higher  foreign  effective  tax  rate,
primarily  due to a provision in 1993 U.S. tax  legislation  and a decrease in
the  proportion  of  income  taxed at lower  foreign  rates.  The  legislation
limited  the U.S.  tax

credit on income we earned in Puerto Rico to 60% of the amount allowed under the
previous tax law beginning on December 1, 1994. The legislation  further reduces
the limit ratably over the following four years to 40%. This  provision  reduced
our 1995 earnings by $58 million or $0.04 per share.

[Note:  Unless otherwise  noted,  net sales and operating  profit  comparisons
within the following  discussions  are based on ongoing  operating  profit and
include the impact of the fifty-third week in 1994 (see Notes 2 and 19).]

System  bottler  case sales (BCS) of Pepsi  Corporate  brands is our  standard
volume  measure.  It  represents  company-owned  brands  as well as  brands we
have the right to produce,  distribute  and market  nationally,  and  includes
sales  of  packaged   products  and  fountain  syrup  by   company-owned   and
franchised  bottlers.  BCS was not  impacted by the  fifty-third  week in 1994
because it is measured on a calendar year basis.

                                1996 vs. 1995
North America
- -------------
Sales in North America rose $325  million.  The gain  reflected  volume growth
of $215  million,  led by  carbonated  soft drink (CSD)  products,  and higher
effective net pricing.
      North  American BCS  increased  4%, with solid  increases in Brand Pepsi
and the Mountain Dew brand.  Alternative  beverages,  led by Aquafina  bottled
water and Hawaiian Punch fountain syrup, grew at a double-digit rate.

                                       21
<PAGE>

     Profit in North America increased $179 million. The growth reflected volume
gains of $117 million, lower product costs and the higher effective net pricing.
Advertising  and  marketing  expenses  grew  significantly  faster  than  sales,
primarily due to the Pepsi Stuff  promotion.  Selling and  distribution  expense
grew at the same rate as sales and  volume.  Profit  growth was aided by lapping
charges  taken in 1995,  primarily for losses on supply  contracts,  take-or-pay
co-packing  penalties and a write-down of excess co-packing  assets. A 1996 gain
on the sale of an investment  in a bottling  cooperative  and a 1996  settlement
with a supplier for purchases made in prior years also helped profit growth.
     Benefits  of   approximately   $130  million   related  to  the  1992  U.S.
restructuring  were achieved in 1996 due to the centralization of purchasing and
improved  administrative and business  processes.  Benefits are expected to grow
until fully  realized in 1998,  when they are  expected to be about $145 million
annually.  All benefits from the restructuring will continue to be reinvested in
the business to strengthen our competitive position.

International
- -------------
Our new  strategy for  International  beverages is to focus on building our core
business in markets in which we are already strong and in emerging markets where
we believe the competitive  playing field is essentially  level. As a result, we
took a  restructuring  charge of $122  million,  which is  described  in Note 3.
Almost  all of the  charge  is  expected  to be  paid by the  end of  1997.  The
restructuring  is expected to generate about $50 million in savings in 1997, and
about $80 million a year thereafter. See Cautionary Statements beginning on page
35. In addition, a largely noncash charge of $454 million was recognized in 1996
related to the impairment of certain  investments in  unconsolidated  affiliates
($216 million), concentrate-related assets ($129 million), assets not related to
the core  International  beverage  business  ($69  million) and our share of the
unusual  charges  recorded  by  BAESA  for  restructuring  actions  and  noncash
accounting charges ($40 million).
     International  sales  declined $183 million,  primarily due to  unfavorable
currency translation impacts and lower volume of $41 million. The volume decline
reflected lower concentrate shipments to franchisees, partially offset by higher
packaged product sales to retailers.
     International  BCS decreased 2%. Excluding the fourth quarter impact of the
unexpected  loss of our  Venezuelan  bottler in August 1996,  BCS declined 1%. A
single-digit   decline  in  Latin  America  was   partially   offset  by  strong
double-digit growth in China and India.
     International  beverages  reported  operating  losses of $846  million or a
decline of $963 million. Excluding the unusual charges,  International beverages
reported an ongoing operating loss of $270 million or a decline of $387 million.
The ongoing  operating loss reflected  broad-based  increases in advertising and
marketing  expenses,  higher-than-normal  expenses from fourth  quarter  balance
sheet  adjustments  and actions,  increased  net losses from our  unconsolidated
affiliates  and a volume  decline of $41 million.  The increased net losses from
our  unconsolidated  affiliates  was driven by our 24%  equity  share of BAESA's
operating losses.

                                1995 vs. 1994

North America
- -------------
Sales in North  America  rose $369  million  or 5%.  The  fifty-third  week in
1994  reduced the sales  growth by  approximately  2 points.  The sales growth
reflected  higher  effective  net pricing on most CSD  packages,  primarily in
response  to  significantly   higher  packaging  prices.   Sales  growth  also
benefited from increased volume, which contributed $92 million.
      North American BCS increased 4%, reflecting  double-digit  growth in the
Mountain Dew brand,  solid  increases  in Brand Pepsi and strong  double-digit
growth in  alternative  beverages,  led by Lipton  brand tea and the All Sport
brand.
      North American  profit  increased  $134 million or 12%. The  fifty-third
week in 1994 reduced the operating  profit growth by  approximately  2 points.
Profit growth  reflected the higher  effective net pricing on CSD packages and
concentrate  which  exceeded the  increased  packaging  costs.  Volume  gains,
driven by packaged  products,  contributed $46 million ($104 million excluding
the  impact of the  fifty-third  week) to the  profit  growth.  Administrative
expenses   declined,   reflecting   savings  from  a  1994   consolidation  of
headquarters  and  field  operations  in the  U.S.  Selling  and  distribution
expenses  declined  as a  percentage  of  sales,  in  part  reflecting  higher
pricing.   Advertising  and  marketing   expenses   decreased,   reflecting  a
reallocation  of  funds  to  support  promotional  discounts  in the  fountain
channel,  which is  classified  as a  reduction  of sales.  In the  aggregate,
advertising  and  marketing  expenses  and fountain  discounts  was about even
with the prior year.
      In 1995, North America  continued to execute actions related to the 1992
U.S.  restructuring.  Benefits  in  1995  were  offset  by  incremental  costs
associated  with  the  continued   development  and   implementation   of  the
restructuring.  Net benefits of  approximately  $130 million were  expected to
begin to be  realized in 1996 and to increase  annually  until fully  realized
in 1998.

International
- -------------
International  sales rose $447  million or 18%. The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced  the  sales  growth by  approximately  1 point.  Start-up  operations,
principally in Eastern  Europe,  and net  acquisitions,  primarily of bottling
operations  in Asia,  together  contributed  5  points  to the  sales  growth.
Sales growth also  benefited  from volume  advances of $205 million and higher
effective net pricing.
      International  BCS grew 8%. This advance  reflected  broad-based  growth
partially  offset  by  declines  in  Mexico,  our  largest  International  BCS
market, and Argentina, both of which had adverse economic conditions.
      International  beverages  reported a profit  decrease  of $19 million or
14%.  Ongoing  operating  profit  declined  $1 million or 1%. The  fifty-third
week in 1994 reduced the ongoing  operating  profit decline by approximately 2
points.  The slight decline in ongoing  operating profit  primarily  reflected
significantly  weaker results in Mexico (discussed  below).  Excluding Mexico,
ongoing  operating profit increased $64 million or 44%,  reflecting  increased
volume,  primarily  concentrate,  of $58 million and the higher  effective net
pricing,  partially  offset  by higher  field  operating  costs and  increased
headquarters  expenses.  Profit  was  also  aided  by a gain on the  sale of a
bottling plant.

<PAGE>

     As discussed in Management's  Analysis -  International  Businesses on page
13, results in Mexico were adversely impacted by economic difficulties resulting
from the significant  devaluation of the peso. Net sales in Mexico declined 37%,
while 1995 operating results declined to a $27 million operating loss, including
losses of $12 million from unconsolidated affiliates formed in 1995, compared to
a $38 million operating profit in 1994.

                                1996 vs. 1995
North America
- -------------
     Sales in North  America grew $755  million.  The sales  increase  reflected
strong volume growth of $495 million and higher effective net pricing across all
core  brands in late 1995 and late 1996.  Volume  grew in almost all core brands
with low-fat and no-fat snacks accounting for over 45% of the sales growth.
     Pound  volume  in  North  America  advanced  9%,   reflecting   exceptional
performance from the low-fat and no-fat categories. These categories contributed
over 45% of the total pound growth, led by Baked Lay's brand potato crisps. Core
brands, excluding their low-fat and no-fat versions, had mid-single-digit growth
led by double-digit  growth in Lay's brand potato chips and strong  double-digit
growth in Tostitos brand tortilla chips.
     Profit in North America grew $137 million.  The profit  increase  reflected
the volume growth,  which contributed $224 million, and the higher effective net
pricing, which exceeded increased promotional price allowances and merchandising
support. The growth rate of promotional price allowances moderated in the fourth
quarter. These gains were partially offset by higher operating and manufacturing
costs and  increased  administrative  expenses.  The increased  operating  costs
reflected increased selling and distribution and advertising  expenses.  Selling
and distribution expenses and manufacturing costs both reflected higher capacity
costs and some  inefficiencies  incurred  to capture  the  volume  opportunities
created  when  Anheuser-Busch  exited  the  salty  snack  food  business.  These
inefficiencies began to moderate in the fourth quarter.  Operating expenses grew
faster than sales for the year. The
                                       24
<PAGE>

increase in  operating  expenses  coupled with higher  administrative  expenses,
partially  reflected  investment  spending to sustain strong volume growth. This
increased  investment  spending,  including  costs of developing and testing new
products, was partially offset by a gain on the sale of a non-core business.

International
- -------------
International  sales  increased  $380  million.  The  sales  increase  reflected
inflation-based  pricing  increases in Mexico and volume growth of $157 million,
partially offset by an unfavorable currency translation impact, led by the peso.
     International kilo growth is reported on a systemwide basis, which includes
both  consolidated  businesses and  unconsolidated  affiliates  operating for at
least one year.  Salty snack kilos rose 8%,  reflecting  double-digit  growth at
Sabritas in Mexico and strong  single-digit  growth by Walkers in the U.K.,  our
two largest  salty snack  businesses.  Sweet snack kilos  declined  2%, led by a
single-digit  decline at Gamesa in Mexico, due to market-wide  contraction and a
double-digit decline at Alegro, the sweet snack division of Sabritas.
     International   operating  profit  increased  $45  million.   The  increase
reflected  higher effective net pricing in advance of  inflation-driven  product
and operating cost increases,  primarily in Mexico, and the increased volumes of
$28  million.  These gains were  partially  offset by  increased  administrative
expenses and the net unfavorable  currency  translation impact.  Advertising and
marketing  expenses  increased,   partially  reflecting   investment  in  global
advertising and design.
     Beginning in 1997, we will categorize  Mexico as highly  inflationary  and,
therefore,  the U.S. dollar will be the functional currency.  Although difficult
to  estimate,  we expect the 1997  reported  results of our  Sabritas and Gamesa
operations  to be slightly  lower than what they would have been had we retained
the peso as our functional currency. See Cautionary Statements beginning on page
35.

                                1995 vs. 1994
North America
- -------------
Sales in North  America  grew $507 million or 9%. The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced the sales  growth by  approximately  2 points.  The  increase  reflected
volume growth of $427 million and higher pricing across all core brands.  Volume
grew in almost all core brands,  with low-fat and no-fat snacks  accounting  for
almost 45% of the total sales growth.
     Pound  volume  in  North  America  advanced  11%,  reflecting   exceptional
performance from the low-fat and no-fat categories. These categories contributed
almost 45% of the total pound growth,  led by Rold Gold brand pretzels and Baked
Tostitos brand tortilla chips.  Core brands,  excluding their low-fat and no-fat
versions, had solid single-digit growth, led by Doritos brand tortilla chips and
Lay's brand potato chips.
     Profit in North America grew $106 million or 10%. The  fifty-third  week in
1994 reduced the profit growth by  approximately  3 points.  The profit increase
reflected  strong volume growth,  which  contributed  $196 million ($247 million
excluding the impact of the fifty-third  week), and higher pricing that exceeded
increased  promotional price allowances and merchandising  support.  This growth
was partially  offset by increased  operating  costs,  driven by higher selling,
distribution and administrative  expenses and increased marketing  investment to
promote strong volume momentum.  Selling and distribution expenses grew at about
the same rate as sales,  while  advertising and marketing costs grew slower than
sales.  The higher  administrative  expenses  reflected  investment  spending to
maintain volume

                                       25
<PAGE>

growth,  including new manufacturing and delivery systems. The profit growth was
also hampered by higher manufacturing costs, reflecting increased capacity costs
and an unfavorable sales mix shift to lower-margin value-oriented packages.

International
- -------------
As discussed in  Management's  Analysis -  International  Businesses on page 13,
1995  results  in  Mexico  were  adversely  impacted  by  economic  difficulties
resulting  from  the  significant  devaluation  of the  peso.  This  effect  was
particularly dramatic on International snack foods results as Mexico represented
almost 75% of its 1994  operating  profit.  Net sales in Mexico  declined 39% in
1995, while operating profit declined $113 million or 44% to $142 million.  As a
result,  Mexico represented about half of 1995 International snack foods profit.
Since  the  change  in  results  of  Mexico  had  such a  distortive  effect  on
International  results, the following net sales and operating profit discussions
exclude the effects of Mexico where noted.
     International  sales decreased $226 million or 8%. Excluding Mexico,  sales
grew more than 35%;  the  fifty-third  week in 1994  reduced the sales growth by
approximately 3 points. This growth reflected increased volumes of $272 million,
a favorable mix shift to higher-priced  packages and products and  acquisitions,
which contributed $43 million.
     Salty snack kilos rose 10%, reflecting strong double-digit volume growth in
Brazil,  the U.K. and our joint  ventures in the  Netherlands  and Spain.  Sweet
snack kilos grew 12%, led by a double-digit advance at Gamesa.
     International  operating profit decreased $53 million. The fifty-third week
in 1994 had no effect on operating  profit.  The principal cause of the decrease
in operating profit was the economic  difficulties in Mexico.  Excluding Mexico,
operating  profit  increased  $58 million or 58%. The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced this profit growth by  approximately 2 points.  Profit growth  reflected
the  favorable  mix shift to  higher-priced  packages and products and increased
volumes  of $45  million,  partially  offset by higher  manufacturing  costs and
increased administrative expenses.


RESTAURANTS
- -----------
An update to our  restaurant  strategy  is  provided  to set the  context of the
operating results discussion beginning on page 29.

STRATEGY UPDATE
- ---------------
In January 1997,  we announced  that we would pursue a plan to spin off our core
restaurant  businesses to our  shareholders  as an  independent  publicly-traded
company. The new company will include both the U.S. and international operations
of Pizza Hut,  Taco Bell and KFC. We are exploring  the  possibility  of selling
PepsiCo Food Systems (PFS), our restaurant  distribution operation. In the first
quarter of 1996,  we  recorded a $26  million  charge  related to a decision  to
dispose of Hot 'n Now (HNN). In the fourth quarter,  we recognized an impairment
loss of $220 million as a result of our decision to sell our remaining  non-core
U.S. restaurant businesses which include California Pizza Kitchen (CPK), Chevys,
D'Angelo  Sandwich Shops  (D'Angelo) and East Side Mario's (ESM). We reduced our
investments in these  businesses to estimated  fair market value,  less costs to
sell.  Estimated  fair market value was based  primarily  upon the opinion of an
investment banking firm. See Notes 3 and 4 and Cautionary  Statements  beginning
on page 35.

                                       26
<PAGE>

      In addition,  we will  continue to execute the strategy we initiated two
years ago to reduce our percentage  ownership in our restaurant  businesses by
selling  company-operated   restaurants  to  franchisees  (refranchising)  and
closing  underperforming  units. Although this refranchising  strategy reduces
reported  sales,  it improves  restaurants  returns and profit by  eliminating
capital  investment  in stores while  generating a franchise  royalty  revenue
stream  which,  in some  cases,  exceeds  the  profit we had  earned  from the
stores  prior  to  refranchising.   In  addition,  margins  benefit  from  the
closing  of  underperforming   stores  in  the   company-operated   portfolio.
Operating  profit  and cash  flows  benefit  from the  one-time  refranchising
gains  (including  initial  franchise  fees).  Our  restaurant  companies have
usually remained  contingently  liable for restaurant  leases assigned as part
of the  refranchising  activity;  however,  we believe  any risk of loss under
these assignments would not be material.

      As a result  of the  unit  activity,  coupled  with  net new  points  of
distribution  added by our  franchisees and licensees,  our overall  ownership
percentage  of total  system units  declined 4 points to 45% at year-end  1996

[Note:  Net  sales and  operating  profit  comparisons  within  the  following
discussions  include the impact of the  fifty-third  week in 1994 (see Notes 2
and 19),  while  same store  sales  growth has been  adjusted  to exclude  its
impact.]

                                1996 vs. 1995
U.S.
- ----
Net sales  decreased $96 million.  The decrease was driven by volume  declines
of  $286  million,   partially   due  to  lapping  the  second   quarter  1995
introduction  of Stuffed  Crust  pizza,  and the  unfavorable  impact of fewer
company  units of $272  million.  These  declines  were  partially  offset  by
higher  effective net pricing and the  consolidation  of CPK at the end of the
second  quarter of 1996.  Same store  sales  decreased  4% and 2% at Pizza Hut
and Taco Bell,  respectively,  reflecting fewer transaction counts. KFC's same
store sales  increased 6% due  primarily to the impact of new products such as
Tender Roast Chicken, Colonel's Crispy Strips and Chunky Chicken Pot Pies.
      Reported  operating  profit  declined  $356 million.  Ongoing  operating
profit  decreased  $110 million  because of higher store  operating  costs,  a
volume  decrease of $166 million and  recurring  noncash  SFAS 121  impairment
charges  of  $54  million.   The  higher  store   operating   costs  reflected
increased labor and food costs,  partially offset by reduced  depreciation and
amortization  expense of $30 million in  connection  with the adoption of SFAS
121.  The above  effects were  partially  offset by the higher  effective  net
pricing  which  exceeded the

increased store operating costs, and by a net refranchising  gain of $89 million
in 1996 compared to $63 million in 1995.

INTERNATIONAL
- -------------
International  sales increased $209 million,  driven by the favorable  impact of
net additional  company units of $112 million,  higher effective net pricing and
increased volumes, which contributed $52 million.
     Operating profit increased $41 million, reflecting the higher effective net
pricing,  a net  refranchising  gain in 1996 of $10  million  compared  to a net
refranchising  loss in 1995 of $8 million,  $18  million  due to net  additional
company  units  and  increased  volumes  of $15  million.  These  benefits  were
partially offset by higher store operating costs,  increased  administrative and
support costs and an $8 million  recurring  noncash SFAS 121 impairment  charge.
The higher  store  operating  costs,  which  exceeded the higher  effective  net
pricing,  primarily  reflected  increased food prices and higher labor costs and
advertising  expenses.  These  increased  store  operating  costs were partially
offset by  reduced  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  of $10  million in
connection  with the adoption of SFAS 121. The profit growth also benefited from
increased equity income.

U.S.
- ----
     Net sales  increased  $510  million  or 6%.  The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced the sales growth by  approximately 1 point.  The sales growth  reflected
$378 million from net additional company units and higher effective net pricing,
partially offset by $52 million of volume  declines.  Same store sales increased
4% and 7% at Pizza  Hut and KFC,  respectively,  driven  by new  products.  Taco
Bell's same store sales declined 4% due to fewer transaction counts.
     Operating  profit grew $89  million or 14%.  The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced the profit growth by  approximately 5 points.  The growth included a net
refranchising  gain of $63  million  in 1995  as  well  as $12  million  for the
write-off of costs associated with sites that will not be developed (undeveloped
sites).  This  compared to $10 million of store  closure costs and $6 million of
undeveloped  site  costs  in  1994.  Profit  growth  was  also  aided by the net
additional company units, which contributed $54 million,  and lower depreciation
and amortization  expense of $11 million in connection with the adoption of SFAS
121. These  benefits were  partially  offset by the lower volumes of $27 million
($24  million  excluding  the  impact of the  fifty-third  week)  and  increased
overhead  costs,  primarily  due to a $17  million  charge in 1995 to move Pizza
Hut's U.S. headquarters from Wichita to Dallas.

INTERNATIONAL
- -------------
International  net sales increased $297 million or 16%. The fifty-third  week in
1994  reduced the sales growth by  approximately  2 points.  The sales  increase
primarily reflected  additional units of $244 million.  International  operating
profit  increased $26 million or 30%. The  fifty-third  week in 1994 reduced the
operating  profit growth rate by  approximately 5 points.  The increased  profit
reflected  higher  effective net pricing and net  additional  company units that
contributed

                                       30
<PAGE>

$22 million. It also reflected reduced  depreciation and amortization expense of
$6  million  as a result of the 1995  adoption  of SFAS 121.  These  gains  were
partially offset by higher store operating costs,  increased  administrative and
support costs and a $17 million  reduction in volume ($14 million  excluding the
impact of the fifty-third  week).  Profit growth was also hampered by $8 million
of net refranchising losses in 1995 and equity losses in 1995 compared to equity
earnings in 1994.


CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS
- -----------------------

Consolidated  cash flows in 1996  reflected  strong  cash  flows from  operating
activities of $4.2 billion,  cash from restaurant  refranchising of $355 million
and cash from stock option  exercises of $323 million.  The cash funded  capital
spending  of $2.3  billion,  share  repurchases  of $1.7  billion  and  dividend
payments of $675  million.  Debt  payments of $801  million  were  substantially
funded by short-term investment proceeds of $775 million.

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING  ACTIVITIES increased $452 million or 12% to $4.2
billion in 1996 due primarily to operating  working capital cash inflows of $179
million in 1996  compared  to net cash  outflows  of $411  million in 1995.  The
change in operating working capital cash flows primarily reflected slower growth
in accounts and notes  receivable  in 1996  compared to 1995,  higher  growth in
accounts payable and other current liabilities and slower growth in inventories.
The slower  growth in accounts  and notes  receivable  reflected  lower sales by
International  beverages  and a sale of $134  million  of  U.S.  trade  accounts
receivable in 1996 to take advantage of favorable effective financing rates. The
growth in accounts payable and other current liabilities was driven primarily by
accruals  related to the 1996 unusual charges and timing of payments,  partially
offset by the impact of our accounts  payable amount remaining about the same as
1995. These cash flow favorabilities were

                                       31
<PAGE>

partially offset by the tax-related decision to stop prefunding certain employee
benefits at the end of 1995.

     Net cash  provided by operating  activities  in 1995 rose $26 million or 1%
over 1994 to $3.7 billion,  primarily  reflecting improved income before noncash
charges and credits  largely offset by the effect of operating  working  capital
cash outflows of $411 million in 1995 compared to cash inflows of $31 million in
1994.

NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING  ACTIVITIES in 1996 decreased $1.2 billion or 48% to
$1.3 billion  compared to an $89 million or 4% increase in 1995 to $2.5 billion.
The 1996 decline was principally due to the repatriation of funds we had held in
Puerto Rico. We manage the  investment  activity in our  short-term  portfolios,
which are  primarily  held  outside the U.S.,  as part of our overall  financing
strategy.  We continually reassess our alternatives to redeploy them considering
investment  opportunities  and risks,  tax  consequences  and current  financing
activity.  As a result of the Small  Business Job  Protection  Act of 1996,  our
exemption from U.S. Federal income tax on investment  income generated in Puerto
Rico was completely eliminated effective as of December 1, 1996. Accordingly, as
our  investments  in Puerto Rico mature,  we are  repatriating  the proceeds and
using them to reduce  outstanding  commercial  paper debt. We  repatriated  $690
million in 1996.
     Capital spending  increased $183 million,  reflecting higher North American
snack foods  investments  of $195  million,  primarily  for capacity  expansion.
Increased spending in worldwide beverages of $85 million was offset by decreased
spending in worldwide  restaurants,  primarily in the U.S.,  of $82 million.  In
1995,  capital spending declined $149 million reflecting  substantially  reduced
spending in  restaurants.  Increased 1995 North  American snack foods  spending,
primarily for capacity  expansion and new  products,  was partially  offset by a
decline in beverages.  Capital spending outside of the U.S. represented 30%, 29%
and 35% of total capital spending in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

NET CASH  USED FOR  FINANCING  ACTIVITIES  more than  doubled  in 1996 to $2.9
billion,   primarily   reflecting  a  $1.1  billion   increase  in  our  share
repurchases  and increased  debt  payments of $498 million.  Net cash used for

      In 1996,  free cash flow increased  $449 million or 41%,  reflecting the
strong  increase  in  net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities.   Higher
proceeds  from  restaurant   refranchising   were  offset  by  higher  capital
spending.   In  1995,  free  cash  flow  advanced  $385  million  or  35%  due
primarily to refranchising of restaurants and the lower capital spending.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION

ASSETS  decreased $920 million or 4% to $24.5 billion.  The decline  reflected
the  repatriation  of funds from our investment  portfolio in Puerto Rico, the
impact of the unusual  impairment, 

                                       33
<PAGE>

disposal  and other  charges of $822 million (see Note 3) and the effects of the
restaurant  program  to  refranchise  stores and close  underperforming  stores,
partially  offset by normal  business  growth.  Short-term  investments  largely
represent high-grade  marketable  securities portfolios held outside the U.S. As
discussed,  we are  repatriating  the funds from our portfolio in Puerto Rico as
our investments  mature and we are using them to reduce our short-term debt. Our
Puerto Rico portfolio  totaled $126 million at year-end 1996 and $816 million at
year-end  1995.  We expect to  repatriate  most of the year-end  1996 balance in
1997. The increase in prepaid expenses,  deferred income taxes and other current
assets principally  reflected a  reclassification  of the carrying amount of our
non-core U.S.  restaurant  long-lived assets,  partially offset by a significant
decline in current deferred income taxes. These non-core  restaurants assets are
now being held for disposal and carried at estimated fair market value.
     LIABILITIES  decreased  $230  million or 1% to $17.9  billion.  The decline
reflected the pay-down of short-term debt with the funds repatriated from Puerto
Rico,   partially  offset  by  increased  accounts  payable  and  other  current
liabilities, due in part to the International beverages restructuring charge.
     At year-end  1996 and 1995,  $3.5  billion of  short-term  borrowings  were
reclassified  as  long-term,  reflecting  our intent and  ability,  through  the
existence  of  our  unused  revolving  credit  facilities,  to  refinance  these
borrowings.  Our unused  credit  facilities,  which exist largely to support the
issuances of short-term borrowings, were $3.5 billion at year-end 1996 and 1995.
Effective  January 10,  1997,  we extended to 2002 $3.3  billion of these credit
facilities.  Annually,  these facilities can be extended an additional year upon
the mutual consent of PepsiCo and the lending institutions.
     Our strong  cash-generating  capability and our strong financial  condition
give us ready access to capital markets throughout the world.
     We measure  FINANCIAL  LEVERAGE on both a market value and historical  cost
basis.  We believe that the most  meaningful  measure of debt is on a net basis,
which takes into account our investment  portfolios  held outside the U.S. These
portfolios  are managed as part of our overall  financing  strategy  and are not
required  to support  day-to-day  operations.  Net debt  reflects  the pro forma
remittance  of the  portfolios  (net of related  taxes) as a reduction  of total
debt. Total debt includes the present value of operating lease commitments.
     We also use market leverage to measure our long-term financial leverage. We
define  market  leverage  as net debt as a percent  of net debt plus the  market
value of equity,  based on the year-end  stock  price.  Unlike  historical  cost
measures,  the market  value of equity  primarily  reflects  the  estimated  net
present  value of  expected  future cash flows that will both  support  debt and
provide returns to shareholders.
     The market net debt ratio was  unchanged  in 1996,  largely  because the 6%
increase  in our  year-end  stock price was offset by a 2% decline in our shares
outstanding.  In 1995,  the market  net debt ratio  declined 8 points to 18% due
primarily to a 54% increase in our stock price.
     Measured on a historical  cost basis,  the ratio of net debt to net capital
employed  (defined as net debt,  other  liabilities,  deferred  income taxes and
shareholders' equity) increased 2 points to 48% in 1996, reflecting a 3% decline
in net  capital  employed.  The  3-point  decline to 46% in 1995  reflected a 2%
decline in net debt and a 4% increase in net capital employed.

      Our negative  operating  working  capital  position,  which reflects the
cash sales nature of our restaurant  operations  partially  offset by our more
working capital  intensive  packaged goods  businesses,  effectively  provides
additional   capital  for  investment.   Operating   working  capital,   which
excludes  short-term  investments  and short-term  borrowings,  was a negative
$313   million  and   negative   $94  million  at  year-end   1996  and  1995,
respectively.  The $219 million  increase in negative  working capital in 1996
primarily  reflected  reclassifications  of a portion of other liabilities and
deferred  income taxes to income taxes payable and accounts  payable and other
current  liabilities,   respectively,  and  a  decline  in  operating  working
capital in our International  beverages  business.  The increase was partially
offset by the  reclassification  of our non-core  U.S.  restaurant  long-lived
assets  held for  disposal  to prepaid  expenses,  deferred  income  taxes and
other  current  assets in the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  The  decline  in
International  beverages  reflected  higher  accrued  liabilities  due  to the
restructuring charge, coupled with lower receivables from a decline in sales.

      SHAREHOLDERS'  EQUITY  decreased  $690  million  or 9% to $6.6  billion.
This  change was the result of a $1.3  billion  increase  in  treasury  stock,
reflecting  repurchases  of 54.2 million  shares offset by 22.7 million shares
used  for  stock  option  exercises.  This  decrease  was  mitigated  by  a 5%
increase  in  retained  earnings  due  to  $1.1  billion  in net  income  less
dividends declared of $695 million.

Cautionary Statements
- ---------------------
From time to time,  in written  reports  and oral  statements,  we discuss our
expectations    regarding   future   performance   of   the   Company.   These
"forward-looking  statements"  are based on currently  available  competitive,
financial  and  economic  data  and  our  operating   plans.   They  are  also
inherently  uncertain,  and investors  must  recognize  that events could turn
out to be significantly  different from what we had expected.  In addition, as
discussed in the Management's Analysis:

- -  The  forecasted  annual  savings  of $50  million  in 1997,  and  about $80
   million  a  year  thereafter   related  to  the   International   beverages
   restructuring  charge  (page 22) assumes  that  facilities  are vacated and
   employees  are  terminated  within  the time  frames  used to  develop  the
   estimate.

                                       35
<PAGE>

- -  The  expectation  that our  reported  results  in Mexico  will be  slightly
   lower  than what they  would have been had we not  changed  our  functional
   currency  from the peso to the U.S.  dollar (page 25) assumes that the peso
   will not devalue significantly in 1997.

- -  The  spin-off  of our core  restaurant  businesses  (page 26) is subject to
   receipt of a tax ruling by the  Internal  Revenue  Service that would allow
   it to be  tax  free  to our  shareholders,  various  regulatory  approvals,
   appropriate  stock market  conditions for  distribution  and final approval
   by our Board of Directors.

- -  The  impairment  charge  recorded to reduce our  investment in our non-core
   U.S.  restaurant  businesses to estimated fair market value assumed certain
   sales  prices based  primarily  upon the opinion of an  investment  banking
   firm.  These  estimates  could  vary  significantly  from the  final  sales
   prices (page 26).

- -  Our  ability to execute  our  restaurant  refranchising  program  (page 28)
   depends on our ability to find  investors  to purchase our  restaurants  at
   prices we consider appropriate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(tabular dollars in millions except per share amounts)

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The  preparation of the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and  assumptions  that affect  reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting   period.   Actual   results   could  differ  from  those   estimates.
     Certain  reclassifications  were made to prior  year  amounts to conform
with the 1996 presentation.  
     PRINCIPLES   OF   CONSOLIDATION.   The  financial statements   reflect  the
consolidated   accounts  of  PepsiCo,   Inc.  and  its  controlled   affiliates.
Intercompany  accounts and  transactions  have been  eliminated.  Investments in
unconsolidated  affiliates in which PepsiCo exercises  significant influence but
not control are accounted  for by the equity  method and PepsiCo's  share of the
net income or loss of its  unconsolidated  affiliates  is  included  in selling,
general and administrative expenses.
     FISCAL YEAR.  PepsiCo's  fiscal year ends on the last  Saturday in December
and,  as a result,  a  fifty-third  week is added  every five or six years.  The
fiscal year ending December 31, 1994 consisted of 53 weeks.
     MARKETING  COSTS.  Marketing  costs are  reported in  selling,  general and
administrative  expenses and include costs of  advertising  and other  marketing
activities.  Marketing  costs not  deferred at  year-end  are charged to expense
ratably  in  relation  to sales  over the  year in which  incurred.  Advertising
expenses  were $1.9  billion,  $1.8 billion and $1.7  billion in 1996,  1995 and
1994,  respectively.  Advertising  expenses  deferred  at  year-end,  which  are
classified in prepaid  expenses,  deferred income taxes and other current assets
in the Consolidated  Balance Sheet, were $49 million and $78 million in 1996 and
1995, respectively.  Deferred advertising consists of media and personal service
advertising-related   prepayments,   promotional   materials  in  inventory  and
production costs of future media  advertising;  these assets are expensed in the
year first used.
     RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. Research and development expenses, which
are expensed as  incurred,  were $115  million,  $96 million and $152 million in
1996, 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  
     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. PepsiCo measures stock-based compensation cost as
the excess of the quoted  market price of PepsiCo's  capital  stock at the grant
date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock. PepsiCo's policy is to
generally grant stock options at fair market value at the date of grant.
     STOCK  SPLIT.  On May 1, 1996  PepsiCo's  Board of  Directors  authorized a
two-for-one stock split of PepsiCo's capital stock effective for shareholders of
record at the close of business on May 10, 1996. The number of authorized shares
was  increased  from  1.8  billion  to  3.6  billion.  The  information  in  the
Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  as well as all  other  share  data in this
report,  have been  adjusted  to reflect  the stock  split and the  increase  in
authorized  shares. The par value remains 1 2/3 cents per share, with capital in
excess of par value  reduced  to reflect  the total par value of the  additional
shares.
     NET INCOME PER SHARE.  Net income per share is  computed  by  dividing  net
income by the weighted  average number of shares and dilutive share  equivalents
(primarily stock options) outstanding (average shares outstanding).

                             F-8

     DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. The interest differential to be paid or received on
an interest rate swap is recognized as an adjustment to interest  expense as the
differential  occurs.  The  interest  differential  not yet  settled  in cash is
reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a receivable or payable under the
appropriate  current  asset or  liability  caption.  If an  interest  rate  swap
position was to be terminated,  the gain or loss realized upon termination would
be deferred and  amortized to interest  expense over the  remaining  term of the
underlying  debt  instrument  it was  intended to modify or would be  recognized
immediately if the underlying debt instrument was settled prior to maturity.
     The  differential  to be paid or  received  on a currency  swap  related to
non-U.S.  dollar  denominated  debt is  charged  or  credited  to  income as the
differential  occurs.  This is fully  offset by the  corresponding  gain or loss
recognized  in income on the currency  translation  of the debt, as both amounts
are based  upon the same  exchange  rates.  The  currency  differential  not yet
settled  in cash is  reflected  in the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  under  the
appropriate  current or noncurrent  receivable or payable caption. If a currency
swap position was to be terminated prior to maturity,  the gain or loss realized
upon termination would be immediately recognized in income.
     A seven-year put option, issued in connection with the formation of a joint
venture with the principal  shareholder of Grupo  Embotellador  de Mexico,  S.A.
(GEMEX) in 1995, an unconsolidated  franchised  bottling affiliate in Mexico, is
marked-to-market  with gains or losses recognized  currently as an adjustment to
PepsiCo's share of the net income of unconsolidated  affiliates.  The offsetting
amount adjusts the carrying amount of the put obligation  which is classified in
other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
     Gains  and  losses  on  futures  contracts  designated  as hedges of future
commodity  purchases  are  deferred  and included in the cost of the related raw
materials when purchased. Changes in the value of futures contracts that PepsiCo
uses to hedge  commodity  purchases are highly  correlated to the changes in the
value of the  purchased  commodity.  If the degree of  correlation  between  the
futures contracts and the purchase  contracts were to diminish such that the two
were no longer considered highly correlated,  subsequent changes in the value of
the futures contracts would be recognized in income.
     CASH EQUIVALENTS.  Cash equivalents  represent funds  temporarily  invested
(with  original  maturities  not  exceeding  three  months) as part of PepsiCo's
management of day-to-day  operating cash receipts and  disbursements.  All other
investment  portfolios,  largely held outside the U.S., are primarily classified
as short-term investments.
     INVENTORIES.  Inventories  are valued at the lower of cost (computed on the
average,  first-in,  first-out or last-in,  first-out  method) or net realizable
value.
     PROPERTY,  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  Property,  plant and equipment  (PP&E) are
stated at cost, except for PP&E that have been impaired,  for which the carrying
amount is reduced to estimated fair market value.  Depreciation is calculated on
a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
     INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis
over appropriate periods, generally ranging from 20 to 40 years.
     RECOVERABILITY  OF  LONG-LIVED  ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED IN THE BUSINESS.
PepsiCo reviews most long-lived  assets,  certain  identifiable  intangibles and
goodwill  related  to  those  assets  to  be  held  and  used  in  the  business
semi-annually  for impairment,  or whenever  events or changes in  circumstances
indicate  that the  carrying  amount of an asset or a group of 

                             F-9
<PAGE>

assets may not be recoverable. PepsiCo uses a history of operating losses as its
primary indicator of potential impairment.  Assets are grouped and evaluated for
impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable  cash flows that
are largely  independent  of the cash flows of other groups of assets  (Assets).
PepsiCo has  identified  the  appropriate  grouping  of Assets to be  individual
restaurants  for the  restaurants  segment  and, for each of the snack foods and
beverages  segments,  Assets are  generally  grouped at the  country  level.  An
impaired  Asset is written down to its estimated  fair market value based on the
best information  available;  PepsiCo generally  measures  estimated fair market
value by  discounting  estimated  future  cash  flows.  Considerable  management
judgment is necessary  to estimate  discounted  future cash flows.  Accordingly,
actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.
     PepsiCo's  methodology  for  determining  and  measuring  impairment of its
investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  and  enterprise  level goodwill was
changed  in 1996 to  conform  with the  methodology  it uses when  applying  the
provisions  of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 121 (SFAS 121),
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be  Disposed  Of,"  except  (a) the  recognition  test for an  investment  in an
unconsolidated  affiliate  compares  the  investment  to a forecast of PepsiCo's
share  of the  unconsolidated  affiliate's  undiscounted  cash  flows  including
interest and taxes,  compared to  undiscounted  cash flows  before  interest and
taxes used for all other long-lived  assets and (b) enterprise level goodwill is
evaluated  at a  country  level  for  the  restaurants  segment,  instead  of by
individual restaurant.  The change in methodology did not have a material impact
in 1996.

(a)     Pre-tax amounts.

PepsiCo  recognized  unusual  impairment,  disposal  and other  charges  of $822
million ($716 million  after-tax or $0.45 per share) in 1996. The  International
beverages  charge  included $454 million  ($429  million  after-tax or $0.27 per
share)  related  primarily  to  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  and
concentrate-related and non-core assets (primarily packaging) and its 24% equity
share of  unusual  charges  recorded  by  BAESA.  In  addition,  it  included  a
restructuring  charge of $122 million ($98 million after-tax or $0.06 per share)
related to a fourth quarter  reorganization into 10 business units and reduction
of  support  staff.  The charge  primarily  reflected  severance-related  costs,
relocation  costs for employees  who, in 1996,  accepted  offers to relocate and
facility  closing costs.  Included in the  International  beverages  charges are
impairment charges of $373 million (see Note 4).
        The non-core  U.S.  restaurant  businesses  charge of $246 million ($189
million after-tax or $0.12 per share) was a result of a decision made by PepsiCo
in the  fourth  quarter  of 1996 to  dispose  of its  non-core  U.S.  restaurant
businesses;  California  Pizza Kitchen (CPK),  Chevys,  D'Angelo  Sandwich Shops
(D'Angelo)  and East Side Mario's (ESM) and a first quarter  decision to dispose
of Hot `n Now (HNN). The charge was primarily composed of impairment charges and
estimated  disposal  costs (see Note 4). The  remaining  carrying  amount of the
assets of these non-core U.S. restaurant  businesses of $333 million is included
in 1996 in Prepaid  expenses,  deferred income taxes and other current assets in
the Consolidated  Balance Sheet as PepsiCo plans to dispose of them in 1997. The
non-core U.S. restaurant  businesses  contributed $394 million, $297 million and
$281 million to net sales in 1996,  1995 and 1994,  respectively.  Excluding the
unusual  impairment,  disposal and other charges in 1996 and 1995,  the non-core
U.S. restaurant businesses incurred operating losses of $10 million, $42 million
and $40 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
        PepsiCo early adopted SFAS 121 as of the beginning of the fourth quarter
of 1995. The initial,  noncash charge upon adoption of SFAS 121 was $520 million
($384 million after-tax or $0.24 per share). See Note 4.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

        The unusual charges and the recurring restaurant charges are included in
unusual  impairment,  disposal  and  other  charges  and  selling,  general  and
administrative expenses, respectively, in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
        The impairment  charges  represented a reduction of the carrying amounts
of impaired Assets to their  estimated fair market value.  For assets to be held
and used in the business,  estimated fair market value was generally  determined
by using discounted estimated future cash flows. The estimated fair market value
for assets to be disposed of was  determined by using  estimated  selling prices
based  primarily upon the opinion of an investment  banking firm,  less costs to
sell.  Considerable  management  judgment is necessary  to estimate  fair market
value. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.
        The  International  beverages  assets  were  deemed  impaired  due  to a
reduction  in  forecasted   cash  flows  that  was   attributable  to  increased
competitive  activity and weakened  macroeconomic  factors in various geographic
regions and an estimate of the fair market value,  less estimated costs to sell,
of certain non-core businesses PepsiCo decided to dispose of.
        The charges for PepsiCo's  non-core U.S. restaurant  businesses  were a
result of decisions made by PepsiCo to dispose of its non-core U.S. restaurant
businesses:  CPK, Chevys, D'Angelo, ESM and HNN. See Note 3.
        The recurring SFAS 121 restaurant  charge  resulted from the semi-annual
impairment  evaluations  of  all  restaurants  that  either  initially  met  the
"two-year history of operating losses" impairment indicator that PepsiCo uses to
identify  potentially  impaired  restaurants  or were  previously  evaluated for
impairment and, due to changes in  circumstances,  a current  forecast of future
cash flows would be expected to be significantly lower than the forecast used in
the prior evaluation.
        PepsiCo early adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
121 (SFAS 121),  "Accounting  for the  Impairment of  Long-Lived  Assets and for
Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of," as of the beginning of the fourth quarter
of 1995. The initial  charge  resulted from PepsiCo  grouping  assets at a lower
level than under its previous  accounting  policy for  evaluating  and measuring
impairment.  This initial charge affected worldwide  
                                      F-13
<PAGE>
restaurants, International beverages and, to a much lesser extent, International
snack foods and certain unconsolidated affiliates.
        As a result of the reduced carrying amount of certain  long-lived assets
due to the adoption of SFAS 121,  depreciation and amortization  expense for the
fourth  quarter of 1995 was reduced by $21 million  ($15  million  after-tax  or
$0.01 per share) and for the first three  quarters  of 1996 by $46 million  ($29
million after-tax or $0.02 per share). See Items Affecting Comparability in Note
19.

Note 9 - LEASES

PepsiCo has noncancelable commitments under both capital and long-term operating
leases,  primarily for restaurant units. Capital and operating lease commitments
expire at various  dates  through  2087 and,  in many  cases,  provide  for rent
escalations  and  renewal  options.  Most  leases  require  payment  of  related
executory  costs,  which include  property  taxes,  maintenance  and  insurance.
Sublease income and sublease receivables were insignificant.
        Future  minimum  commitments  under  noncancelable  leases are set forth
below:

</TABLE>
The  interest  rates in the above  table  included  the  effects  of  associated
interest rate and currency  swaps at year-end  1996 and 1995.  See Note 11 for a
discussion of PepsiCo's use of interest rate and currency swaps,  its management
of the  inherent  credit  risk and fair  value  information  related to debt and
interest rate and currency swaps.
        The carrying  amount of long-term debt includes any related  discount or
premium and unamortized debt issuance costs. The debt agreements include various
restrictions, none of which are currently significant to PepsiCo.
        The annual maturities of long-term debt through 2001,  excluding capital
lease obligations and the reclassified  short-term  borrowings,  are:  1997-$1.9
billion,  1998-$1.9 billion,  1999-$1.1 billion, 2000-$952 million and 2001-$218
million.
        (A) The  following  table  indicates  the  notional  amount and weighted
average  interest  rates,  by category,  of interest rate swaps  outstanding  at
year-end 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  The weighted average  variable  interest
rates that PepsiCo pays, which are primarily  indexed to either commercial paper
or LIBOR rates, were based on rates as of the respective  balance sheet date and
are subject to change. Terms of interest rate swaps generally match the terms of
the debt they modify. The swaps terminate at various dates through 2011.

</TABLE>

        (B) Included certain long-term notes aggregating $110 million, which are
reasonably expected to be called,  without penalty, by PepsiCo in 1997. The 1996
amount was $248  million.  The  expectation  is based upon the belief of PepsiCo
management  that,  based upon  projected  yield curves,  our  counterparties  to
interest  rate  swaps,  which were  entered  into to modify  these  notes,  will
exercise  their  option to early  terminate  the  swaps  without  penalty.  Also
included  in 1995  is the  $214  million  carrying  amount  of the  Swiss  franc
perpetual  Foreign  Interest  Payment  bonds in 1995,  which were expected to be
redeemed  in 1996.  At  year-end  1996,  $39  million of these  bonds were still
outstanding and are classified as long-term debt (see (E) below).
        (C)  PepsiCo  has  entered  into  currency  swaps to hedge its  currency
exposure on non-U.S.  dollar  denominated  debt. At year-end 1996, the aggregate
carrying  amount of the debt was $1.8 billion and the  receivables  and payables
under  related  currency  swaps were $54 million and $59 million,  respectively,
resulting  in a net  effective  U.S.  dollar  liability  of $1.8  billion with a
weighted  average  interest  rate of 5.6%,  including  the  

                             F-17

<PAGE>

effects of related interest rate swaps. At year-end 1995, the carrying amount of
this debt aggregated $696 million and the receivables and payables under related
currency swaps aggregated $5 million and $12 million, respectively, resulting in
a net effective U.S.  dollar  liability of $703 million with a weighted  average
interest rate of 5.8%, including the effects of related interest rate swaps.
        (D) At  year-end  1996 and 1995,  PepsiCo  had unused  revolving  credit
facilities  covering potential  borrowings  aggregating $3.5 billion expiring in
2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Effective  January 10, 1997,  PepsiCo extended to
2002 $3.3  billion of the credit  facilities.  At year-end  1996 and 1995,  $3.5
billion of short-term  borrowings were classified as long-term debt,  reflecting
PepsiCo's  intent and  ability,  through  the  existence  of the  unused  credit
facilities, to refinance these borrowings. These credit facilities exist largely
to support the issuances of short-term  borrowings and are available for general
corporate purposes.
        (E) The coupon  rate of the Swiss franc 400  million  perpetual  Foreign
Interest  Payment bonds issued in 1986 was 7 1/2% through 1996, and 5.6% through
2006. The bonds have no stated  maturity date. At the end of each 10-year period
after the issuance of the bonds, PepsiCo and the bondholders each have the right
to cause  redemption  of the bonds.  If not  redeemed,  the coupon  rate will be
adjusted based on the prevailing yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury Securities.  The
principal of the bonds is denominated in Swiss francs.  PepsiCo can, and intends
to,  limit  the  ultimate  redemption  amount  to the U.S.  dollar  proceeds  at
issuance,  which is the basis of the carrying amount. Interest payments are made
in U.S.  dollars and are  calculated by applying the coupon rate to the original
U.S. dollar principal proceeds.  This debt was included in current maturities of
long-term debt (see (B) above) at year-end 1995 because the  bondholders had the
right to cause  PepsiCo  to redeem the debt in 1996 on its  10-year  anniversary
date. During 1996, $175 million of this debt was redeemed.


Note 11 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Derivative Instruments
- ----------------------
PepsiCo's  policy  prohibits  the  use of  derivative  instruments  for  trading
purposes and PepsiCo has procedures in place to monitor and control their use.
        PepsiCo's use of derivative instruments is primarily limited to interest
rate and currency  swaps,  which are entered into with the objective of reducing
borrowing  costs.  PepsiCo  enters  into  interest  rate and  currency  swaps to
effectively  change the interest rate and currency of specific  debt  issuances.
These swaps are  generally  entered into  concurrently  with the issuance of the
debt they are intended to modify.  The notional  amount,  interest payment dates
and maturity dates of the swaps generally match the principal,  interest payment
dates and maturity  dates of the related debt.  Accordingly,  any market risk or
opportunity  associated with these swaps is offset by the opposite market impact
on the related debt. PepsiCo's credit risk related to interest rate and currency
swaps is  considered  low  because  they  are  only  entered  into  with  strong
creditworthy  counterparties,  are  generally  settled on a net basis and are of
relatively  short  duration.  See  Note 10 for  the  notional  amounts,  related
interest rates and maturities of the interest rate and currency swaps.

</TABLE>

     The carrying  amounts in the above table are  included in the  Consolidated
Balance Sheet under the indicated captions,  except for debt-related  derivative
instruments  (interest  rate and  currency  swaps),  which are  included  in the
appropriate  current  or  noncurrent  asset  or  liability  caption.  Short-term
investments  consist  primarily of debt  securities and have been  classified as
held-to-maturity. Noncurrent investments mature at various dates through 2000.
     Because  of  the  short  maturity  of  cash   equivalents   and  short-term
investments,  the carrying  amount  approximates  fair value.  The fair value of
noncurrent  investments  is based upon  market  quotes.  The fair value of debt,
debt-related  derivative  instruments  and guarantees is estimated  using market
quotes,  valuation models and calculations based on market rates. The fair value
of the GEMEX put option (see Note 1) is based upon a valuation model.


Note 12 - EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

PepsiCo grants stock options to employees pursuant to three different  incentive
plans - the SharePower Stock Option Plan (SharePower),  the Long-Term  Incentive
Plan (LTIP) and the Stock Option Incentive Plan (SOIP).  All stock option grants
are  authorized by the  Compensation  Committee of 

                             F-19
<PAGE>

PepsiCo's  Board of  Directors  (the Committee),  which is  comprised of outside
directors.
      Under  SharePower,  approved by the Board of  Directors  and  effective in
1989,  essentially all full-time  employees,  other than executive  officers and
short-service  employees,  may be granted stock options annually.  The number of
options  granted  is based  on each  employee's  annual  earnings.  The  options
generally become  exercisable  ratably over 5 years from the grant date and must
be exercised within 10 years of the grant date. SharePower options of 12 million
were granted to approximately  130,000  employees in 1996; 16 million to 134,000
employees in 1995; and 23 million to 128,000 employees in 1994.
      The  shareholder-approved  1994 LTIP  succeeds and continues the principal
features of the  shareholder-approved  1987 LTIP (the 1987 Plan). PepsiCo ceased
making  grants  under the 1987 Plan at the end of 1994.  Together,  these  plans
comprise the LTIP. At year-end 1996, there were 121 million shares available for
future grants under the LTIP.
      Most LTIP stock options are granted every other year to senior  management
employees.  Most of these options become  exercisable  after 4 years and must be
exercised  within 10 years from their grant date.  In addition,  the LTIP allows
for grants of performance share units (PSUs). The value of a PSU is fixed at the
value of a share of stock at the grant  date and vests for  payment 4 years from
the grant date,  contingent upon attainment of prescribed Corporate  performance
goals.  PSUs are not directly  granted,  as certain stock options granted may be
exchanged  by  employees  for a  specified  number of PSUs within 60 days of the
option  grant  date.  At  year-end  1996,  1995 and 1994,  there  were  916,100,
1,198,200 and 1,258,400 PSUs outstanding, respectively. Payment of PSUs are made
in cash and/or  stock as approved by the  Committee.  Amounts  expensed for PSUs
were $5 million for both 1996 and 1995 and $7 million in 1994.
      In  1995,  the  Committee  approved  the 1995  SOIP for  middle-management
employees.  SOIP stock  options  are  expected  to be granted  annually  and are
exercisable after 1 year and must be exercised within 10 years after their grant
date. At year-end 1996, there were 37 million shares available for future grants
under the SOIP. In 1994,  grants similar to those under the SOIP were made under
the LTIP to a more limited number of middle-management employees.
      Effective  in  1996,  PepsiCo  adopted  the  disclosure   requirements  of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123),  "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation." As permitted under SFAS 123, PepsiCo will continue to
measure  stock-based  compensation cost as the excess of the quoted market price
of PepsiCo's  capital  stock at the grant date over the amount the employee must
pay for the stock.
      SFAS 123  requires  disclosure  of pro forma net  income and pro forma net
income per share as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring
compensation  cost for stock-based  awards granted in 1996 and 1995.  Management
believes  that 1996 and 1995 pro forma  amounts  are not  representative  of the
effects of  stock-based  awards on future pro forma net income and pro forma net
income  per  share  because  those  pro  forma  amounts  exclude  the pro  forma
compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted before 1995.

Note 13 - POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN TO RETIREES

Effective  the  beginning  of  1994,  PepsiCo  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting   Standards   No.  112  (SFAS  112),   "Employers'   Accounting   for
Postemployment Benefits." The principal effect to PepsiCo resulted from accruing
severance benefits to be provided to employees of certain business units who are
terminated in the ordinary course of business over the expected service lives of
the employees. Previously, these benefits were accrued upon the occurrence of an
event.  Severance  benefits resulting from actions not in the ordinary course of
business will continue to be accrued when those actions  occur.  The  cumulative
effect charge upon  adoption of SFAS 112,  which relates to years prior to 1994,
was $84 million ($55 million after-tax or $0.03 per share).


Note 14 - POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

PepsiCo  provides  postretirement  health  care  benefits  to  eligible  retired
employees and their  dependents,  principally  in the U.S.  Retirees who have 10
years of service and attain age 55 while in service with PepsiCo are eligible to
participate in the  postretirement  benefit plans.  The plans are not funded and
were largely noncontributory through 1993.
        Effective in 1993 and 1994,  PepsiCo  implemented  programs  intended to
stem rising costs and  introduced  retiree  cost-sharing,  including  adopting a
provision  that  limits  its  future  obligation  to  absorb  health  care  cost
inflation.  These amendments  resulted in an unrecognized  prior service gain of
$191 million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the average
remaining  employee  service period of  approximately 10 years as a reduction in
postretirement benefit expense beginning in 1993.

</TABLE>

     The   discount   rate   assumptions   used  to  compute   the   accumulated
postretirement  benefit  obligation  were  7.8%  and  7.7%  in  1996  and  1995,
respectively.

     As a result of the plan amendments discussed above, separate assumed health
care cost trend  rates are used for  employees  who retire  before and after the
effective  date of the  amendments.  The assumed health care cost trend rate for
employees  who retired  before the effective  date was 8.1% for 1997,  declining
gradually  to 5.5% in 2010 and  thereafter.  For  employees  retiring  after the
effective date, the trend rate was 7.0% for 1997,  declining to zero in 2004 and
thereafter.  A 1 point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would
have increased the 1996  postretirement  benefit expense by $2 million and would
have increased the 1996  accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligation by $23
million.


Note 15 - PENSION PLANS

PepsiCo  sponsors   noncontributory   defined  benefit  pension  plans  covering
substantially  all  full-time  U.S.   employees  as  well  as  contributory  and
noncontributory  defined  benefit pension plans covering  certain  international
employees.  Benefits generally are based on years of service and compensation or
stated amounts for each year of service. PepsiCo funds the U.S. plans in amounts
not less than minimum statutory  funding  requirements nor more than the maximum
amount that can be deducted for U.S.  income tax purposes.  International  plans
are funded in amounts  sufficient to comply with local  statutory  requirements.
The plans' assets  consist  principally  of equity  securities,  government  and
corporate debt securities and other  fixed-income  obligations.  The U.S. plans'
assets included 12.2

                             F-23
<PAGE>


million and 13.7 million shares of PepsiCo  capital stock in 1996 and 1995, with
a market value of $344 million and $350 million,  respectively.  In the interest
of maintaining an appropriate  level of  diversification  within the U.S. plans'
asset  portfolio,  1.5 million shares of PepsiCo  capital stock were sold during
the 1996 plan  year to offset  the large  increase  in market  value of  PepsiCo
capital stock holdings relative to other portfolio assets.  Dividends on PepsiCo
capital  stock of $5 million  were  received by the U.S.  plans in both 1996 and
1995.

The discount  rates and rates of return for the  international  plans  represent

        In 1994,  PepsiCo changed the method for calculating the  market-related
value of plan assets  used in  determining  the  return-on-assets  component  of
annual pension expense and the cumulative net unrecognized  gain or loss subject
to amortization.  Under the previous  accounting  method, the calculation of the
market-related  value of assets  reflected  amortization  of the actual  capital
return on assets on a straight-line basis over a five-year period. Under the new
method,  the  calculation  of the  market-related  value of assets  reflects the
long-term rate of return expected by PepsiCo and  amortization of the difference
between the actual return  (including  capital,  dividends and interest) and the
expected  return over a five-year  period.  PepsiCo  believes  the new method is
widely used in practice and is preferable  because it results in calculated plan
asset values that more closely  approximate  fair value,  while still mitigating
the  effect of annual  market-value  fluctuations.  This  change  resulted  in a
noncash  benefit in 1994 of $38  million  ($23  million  after-tax  or $0.01 per
share)  representing the cumulative  effect of the change related to years prior
to 1994.

         PepsiCo operates centralized  concentrate  manufacturing  facilities in
Puerto Rico and Ireland under long-term tax  incentives.  The U.S. amount in the
above table  included  approximately  73%,  70% and 50% in 1996,  1995 and 1994,
respectively,  (consistent  with the income  subject to U.S.  tax) of the income
from sales of concentrate manufactured in Puerto Rico. The increases in 1996 and
1995  reflected  the effects of the 1993 U.S.  Federal  income tax  legislation,
which limited the U.S.  Federal tax credit on income earned in Puerto Rico.  See
Management's  Analysis - Provision for Income  Taxes  beginning on page 17 for a
discussion  of the  reduction  of the U.S.  Federal tax credit  associated  with
beverage concentrate operations in Puerto Rico.

         In accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles,  deferred
tax  liabilities  have  not  been  recognized  for  bases  differences  that are
essentially permanent in duration related to investments in foreign subsidiaries
and unconsolidated  affiliates.  These  differences,  which consist primarily of
unremitted   earnings  intended  to  be  indefinitely   reinvested,   aggregated
approximately  $4.0 billion at year-end 1996 and $4.5 billion at year-end  1995,
exclusive of amounts that if remitted in the future would result in little or no
tax  under  current  tax  laws  and  the  Puerto  Rico  tax   incentive   grant.
Determination  of the amount of  unrecognized  deferred tax  liabilities  is not
practicable.

</TABLE>

     The  valuation  allowance  related to deferred tax assets  increased by $62
million in 1996  primarily  due to additions  related to current year  operating
losses and temporary differences in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions.
     Net operating loss carryforwards totaling $2.5 billion at year-end 1996 are
available  to reduce  future tax of certain  subsidiaries  and are  related to a
number of foreign and state jurisdictions.  Of these carryforwards,  $21 million
expire in 1997,  $2.2 billion  expire at various times between 1998 and 2010 and
$291 million may be carried forward indefinitely.
     Tax benefits  associated with exercises of stock options of $145 million in
1996, $91 million in 1995 and $27 million in 1994 were credited to shareholders'
equity.


Note 17 - STOCK OFFERING BY AN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE

In 1993, PepsiCo entered into an arrangement with the principal  shareholders of
Buenos Aires  Embotelladora  S.A. (BAESA),  a franchised bottler which currently
has operations in Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile, Costa Rica and Uruguay,  to form a
joint venture. PepsiCo contributed certain assets, primarily bottling operations
in Chile and Uruguay, while the principal shareholders  contributed all of their
shares in BAESA, representing 73% of the voting control and 43% of the ownership
interest.  Through this arrangement,  PepsiCo's  beneficial  ownership in BAESA,
which  is  accounted  for  by  the  equity  method,  was  26%.  Under  PepsiCo's
partnership  

                             F-29
<PAGE>

agreement with the principal shareholders of BAESA, voting control of BAESA will
be transferred to PepsiCo no later than December 31, 1999.
        On March  24,  1994,  BAESA  completed  a public  offering  of 3 million
American  Depositary Shares (ADS) at $34.50 per ADS, which are traded on the New
York Stock Exchange. In conjunction with the offering, PepsiCo and certain other
shareholders  exercised options for the equivalent of 2 million ADS. As a result
of these  transactions,  PepsiCo's  ownership  in  BAESA  declined  to 24%.  The
transactions  generated  cash proceeds for BAESA of $136 million.  The resulting
one-time,  noncash  gain to PepsiCo was $18 million  ($17  million  after-tax or
$0.01 per share).


Note 18 - CONTINGENCIES

PepsiCo  is subject to various  claims and  contingencies  related to  lawsuits,
taxes,  environmental  and other  matters  arising  out of the normal  course of
business.  Management believes that the ultimate liability, if any, in excess of
amounts  already  recognized  arising from such claims or  contingencies  is not
likely  to have a  material  adverse  effect  on  PepsiCo's  annual  results  of
operations  or  financial  condition.  PepsiCo  was  contingently  liable  under
guarantees  for $338  million  and  $283  million  at  year-end  1996 and  1995,
respectively.  At year-end 1996, $74 million represented  contingent liabilities
to lessors as a result of PepsiCo  assigning  its interest in real estate leases
as a condition to the  refranchising of  company-operated  restaurants.  The $74
million  represented  the present value of the minimum  payments of the assigned
leases,  excluding any renewal option periods,  discounted at PepsiCo's  pre-tax
cost of debt. On a nominal basis,  the contingent  liability  resulting from the
assigned  leases was $115  million.  The balance of the  contingent  liabilities
primarily  reflected  guarantees to support  financial  arrangements  of certain
unconsolidated affiliates, and other restaurant franchisees.


Note 19 - BUSINESS SEGMENTS

PepsiCo operates on a worldwide basis within three industry segments: beverages,
snack foods and restaurants.  However,  as discussed in Note 21 and Management's
Analysis - Restaurants  beginning on page 26, PepsiCo  announced in 1997 that it
would pursue a spin off of its Pizza Hut,  Taco Bell and KFC  businesses  to its
shareholders  as  an  independent   publicly-traded   company  and  explore  the
possibility that PFS would be sold separately. In addition,  decisions were made
in 1996 to sell PepsiCo's non-core U.S. restaurant businesses (see Note 3).

Beverages
- ---------
The beverage segment  (beverages)  markets and distributes its Pepsi-Cola,  Diet
Pepsi,  Mountain Dew and other brands  worldwide,  and 7UP,  Diet 7UP,  Mirinda,
Pepsi Max and other brands internationally.  Beverages manufactures concentrates
of its brands for sale to  franchised  bottlers  worldwide.  Beverages  operates
bottling  plants and  distribution  facilities  located in North  America and in
various   International   markets  for  the  production  and   distribution   of
company-owned  and licensed brands.  Beverages also manufactures and distributes
ready-to-drink Lipton tea products in North America.

                             F-30
<PAGE>

     Beverages  products are available in 191 countries and territories  outside
North America,  including  emerging  markets such as China,  the Czech Republic,
Hungary,  India, Poland,  Russia and Slovakia.  Principal  International markets
include Argentina,  Brazil, China, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Thailand and the
U.K.  Investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  are  primarily in  franchised
bottling and distribution operations.  Internationally,  the largest investments
in unconsolidated affiliates are GEMEX (Mexico), General Bottlers (Poland), Serm
Suk  (Thailand)  and SOPRESA  (Venezuela)  as well as the  aggregate  of several
investments in China. The primary investment in the U.S. is General Bottlers.

Snack Foods
- -----------
The snack food segment (snack foods) manufactures, distributes and markets salty
and sweet snacks  worldwide,  with  Frito-Lay  representing  the North  American
business.  Products  primarily  manufactured  and  distributed  in North America
include  Lay's and  Ruffles  brand  potato  chips,  Doritos and  Tostitos  brand
tortilla chips, Fritos brand corn chips,  Chee.tos brand cheese flavored snacks,
Rold Gold brand pretzels, a variety of dips and salsas and other brands. Low-fat
and no-fat versions of several core brands are also manufactured and distributed
in North  America.  Snack Foods  products  are  available  in 81  countries  and
territories  outside North  America.  Principal  International  markets  include
Australia,  Brazil, France, Mexico, the Netherlands,  Poland, Spain and the U.K.
International  snack foods  manufactures and distributes  salty snacks in almost
all countries and sweet snacks in certain countries, primarily in France, Mexico
and Poland.  Snack Foods has  investments in several  unconsolidated  affiliates
outside the U.S., the largest of which are Snack Ventures  Europe (SVE), a joint
venture with General  Mills,  Inc.,  which has  operations  on the  continent of
Europe, and an investment in Simba, a snack food operation in South Africa.

Restaurants
- -----------
The restaurant  segment  (restaurants) is engaged  principally in the operation,
development, franchising and licensing of the worldwide Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and
KFC concepts. Restaurants also operates other non-core U.S. businesses including
CPK, Chevys,  D'Angelo, ESM and HNN. PepsiCo Restaurant Services Group (PRSG), a
new unit formed in 1996 which also  includes  the  existing  operations  of PFS,
PepsiCo's   restaurant   distribution   operation,   is   responsible   for  the
consolidation of many restaurants  activities.  The activities include licensing
arrangements in non-traditional  locations, real estate and asset management and
accounting   services  for  the  U.S.   operations   in  addition  to  worldwide
procurement.  PFS provides  food,  supplies and  equipment to  company-operated,
franchised and licensed units, principally in the U.S. Net sales and the related
estimated  operating profit of PFS' franchisee and licensee operations have been
included in U.S. restaurants results.
        Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC operate  throughout the U.S. Pizza Hut, KFC
and, to a lesser  extent,  Taco Bell  operate in 94  countries  and  territories
outside the U.S.  Principal  international  markets include  Australia,  Canada,
Japan,  Korea,  Mexico,  New  Zealand,   Spain  and  the  U.K.  Restaurants  has
investments  in several  unconsolidated  affiliates  outside the U.S.,  the most
significant of which are located in Japan and the U.K.

                             F-31
<PAGE>

        Unallocated  expenses,  net included  corporate  headquarters  expenses,
minority  interests,  primarily in the Gamesa  (Mexico) and Wedel (Poland) snack
food businesses,  foreign exchange  translation and transaction gains and losses
and other items not allocated to the business segments.  Corporate  identifiable
assets  consist   principally  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term
investments, primarily held outside the U.S.
        PepsiCo has invested in about 85  unconsolidated  affiliates in which it
exercises significant influence but not control. As noted above, the investments
are primarily  international  and  principally  within  PepsiCo's three industry
segments.
        PepsiCo's year-end investments in unconsolidated affiliates totaled $1.4
billion in 1996 and $1.6  billion in 1995.  The decrease in 1996  reflected  the
unusual  impairment,  disposal  and other  charges of $256  million  recorded by
International  beverages (see below) and the consolidation of CPK, previously an
unconsolidated  equity  investment,  at the end of the  second  quarter of 1996.
Significant investments in unconsolidated affiliates at year-end 1996 included a
combined  $306  million in General  Bottlers  U.S.  and Poland,  $206 million in
GEMEX, $140 million in a KFC Japan joint venture and $99 million in SVE.

ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY

UNUSUAL IMPAIRMENT, DISPOSAL AND OTHER CHARGES
Beverages and  restaurants  operating  profit and equity (loss) income  included
$320  million,  $246  million  and  $256  million,   respectively,   of  unusual
impairment,  disposal  and  other  charges  in 1996.  The  charges  included  in
beverages  operating  profit  and equity  (loss)  income  reflected  impairment,
disposal and other costs related to International  investments in unconsolidated
affiliates  and  concentrate-related  and  non-core  assets  as  well  as  costs
associated with a restructuring  of  International  operations.  The restaurants
charge  reflected  management's  decisions  in  1996  to  dispose  of all of its
non-core U.S. restaurant  businesses:  CPK, Chevys,  D'Angelo,  ESM and HNN. See
Note 3.
        PepsiCo  adopted SFAS 121 as of the  beginning of the fourth  quarter of
1995.  See Note 4. The initial,  noncash  charges  reduced  operating  profit as

        As a result of the  reduced  carrying  amount of  certain  of  PepsiCo's
long-lived  assets to be held and used in the  business in  connection  with the
1995 adoption of SFAS 121,  depreciation and amortization  expense for the first
three quarters of 1996 and the fourth quarter of 1995 was reduced by $46 million

RECURRING RESTAURANT IMPAIRMENT
Restaurants  operating profit in 1996 included impairment charges of $62 million
as a result of the ongoing application of SFAS 121 to long-lived assets held and
used in the business. See Note 4.

NET REFRANCHISING GAINS
Restaurants  operating profit in 1996 and 1995 included net gains of $99 million
and $55 million,  respectively,  from  refranchising of restaurants in excess of
the cost of closing other  restaurants.  These gains  compared to $10 million of
costs in 1994 to close stores.

FISCAL YEAR
Fiscal year 1994 consisted of 53 weeks, and the years 1995 and 1996 consisted of
52 weeks.  The  fifty-third  week  increased 1994  consolidated  net sales by an
estimated $434 million and beverages,  snack foods and  restaurants net sales by
$119 million, $143 million and $172 million,  respectively. The fifty-third week
increased  1994  consolidated  operating  profit by an estimated $65 million and
beverages,  snack foods and  restaurants  operating  profit by $17 million,  $26
million and $23 million,  respectively,  and increased unallocated expenses, net
by $1 million.

Notes:

(a)   Included certain items affecting  comparability  as summarized  below. Net
      refranchising   gains   represent  gains  from  sales  of  restaurants  to
      franchisees  in  excess  of  costs  of  closing  other  restaurants.   The
      depreciation  and  amortization  reduction for the first three quarters of
      1996 arose from the  adoption of SFAS 121, at the  beginning of the fourth
      quarter of 1995,  which reduced the carrying amount of certain  long-lived
      assets to be held and used in the  business  (see Note 4). The  restaurant
      impairment charges represent the ongoing application of SFAS 121 (see Note
      4).

Note 21 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In January 1997,  PepsiCo  announced that it would pursue a plan to spin off its
restaurant  businesses to its  shareholders as an independent  publicly-  traded
company. The new company will include both the U.S. and international operations
of PepsiCo's core restaurant concepts - Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC. PepsiCo is
exploring the possibility that PFS, our restaurant distribution operation,  will
be sold separately. Subject to a 

                             F-40
<PAGE>

tax ruling by the Internal  Revenue  Service that would allow the spin off to be
tax free to shareholders, various regulatory approvals, appropriate stock market
conditions  for  distribution,  and  final  approval  from  PepsiCo's  Board  of
Directors, PepsiCo expects to complete these activities by the end of 1997.

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To Our Shareholders:

Management is  responsible  for the  reliability of the  consolidated  financial
statements  and  related  notes,  which have been  prepared in  conformity  with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and include  amounts based upon our
estimates  and  assumptions,  as required.  The financial  statements  have been
audited and reported on by our independent auditors,  KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, who
were given free access to all  financial  records and  related  data,  including
minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors  and  Committees of the Board.
We believe that management representations made to the independent auditors were
valid and appropriate.

        PepsiCo maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting,
designed to provide reasonable  assurance as to the reliability of the financial
statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition.
The system is supported by formal policies and  procedures,  including an active
Code of Conduct  program  intended  to ensure  employees  adhere to the  highest
standards of personal  and  professional  integrity.  PepsiCo's  internal  audit
function  monitors  and  reports  on the  adequacy  of and  compliance  with the
internal  control  system,   and  appropriate   actions  are  taken  to  address
significant  control  deficiencies  and other  opportunities  for  improving the
system as they are  identified.  The Audit  Committee of the Board of Directors,
which is  composed  solely  of  outside  directors,  provides  oversight  to our
financial  reporting  process  and our  controls  to  safeguard  assets  through
periodic  meetings  with  our  independent   auditors,   internal  auditors  and
management. Both our independent auditors and internal auditors have free access
to the Audit Committee.

        Although no  cost-effective  internal  control  system will preclude all
errors and  irregularities,  we believe our  controls  as of  December  28, 1996
provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are reliable and that
our assets are reasonably safeguarded.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


Board of Directors and Shareholders
PepsiCo, Inc.


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and
Subsidiaries  as of  December  28,  1996 and  December  30, 1995 and the related
consolidated  statements of income, cash flows and shareholders' equity for each
of  the  years  in  the  three-year   period  ended  December  28,  1996.  These
consolidated  financial  statements are the  responsibility  of PepsiCo,  Inc.'s
management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

        We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

        In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above
present fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of PepsiCo,
Inc. and  Subsidiaries  as of December  28, 1996 and December 30, 1995,  and the
results  of its  operations  and its cash  flows  for  each of the  years in the
three-year period ended December 28, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

        As  discussed  in  Note  4 to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,
PepsiCo,  Inc.  in 1995  adopted  the  provisions  of the  Financial  Accounting
Standards  Board's  Statement  of  Financial   Accounting   Standards  No.  121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of." As discussed in Notes 15 and 13 to the  consolidated  financial
statements,  PepsiCo,  Inc.  in 1994  changed  its  method for  calculating  the
market-related value of pension plan assets used in the determination of pension
expense and adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers'  Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits," respectively.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA                                        (Page 6 of 7)
(in millions except per share and employee amounts, unaudited)
PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        All share and per share  amounts  reflect a  two-for-one  stock split in
1996 and three-for-one stock splits in 1990 and 1986. Additionally, PepsiCo made
numerous  acquisitions in most years presented and a few divestitures in certain
years.  Such  transactions  did  not  materially  affect  the  comparability  of
PepsiCo's operating results for the periods presented,  except for certain large
acquisitions  made in 1986,  1988 and 1989 and the $246 ($189 after-tax or $0.12
per  share) of charges  included  in 1996 as a result of the  decisions  made to
dispose of PepsiCo's non-core U.S. restaurant businesses. See Note 3.

(a)     Included  unusual  impairment,  disposal and other charges of $822 ($716
        after-tax or $0.45 per share).  See Note 3. Also included the benefit of
        reduced  depreciation  and  amortization  expense  for the  first  three
        quarters of 1996 of $46 ($29  after-tax  or $0.02 per share) as a result
        of the  initial  impact  of  adopting  SFAS  121,  "Accounting  for  the
        Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
        Of" at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 1995. See (c) below.
(b)     Included a net   refranchising  gain of $99 ($61 after-tax or $0.04 per 
        share) and $55 ($29 after-tax or $0.02 per share) in 1996 and 1995, re-
        spectively.
(c)     Included the initial,  noncash  charge of $520 ($384  after-tax or $0.24
        per share)  upon  adoption  of SFAS 121 at the  beginning  of the fourth
        quarter.  As  a  result  of  the  reduced  carrying  amount  of  certain
        long-lived assets to be held and used in the business,  depreciation and
        amortization  expense  for the fourth  quarter  was  reduced by $21 ($15
        after-tax or $0.01 per share). See Note 4.
(d)     Included a benefit of changing to a  preferable  method for  calculating
        the market-related value of plan assets in 1994, which reduced full-year
        pension expense by $35 ($22 after-tax or $0.01 per share).
(e)     Fiscal years 1994 and 1988 each consisted of 53 weeks. Normally,  fiscal
        years consist of 52 weeks; however,  because the fiscal year ends on the
        last  Saturday  in  December,  a week is added  every 5 or 6 years.  The
        fifty-third  week  increased  1994  earnings by  approximately  $54 ($35
        after-tax  or $0.02 per share) and 1988  earnings by  approximately  $23
        ($16 after-tax or $0.01 per share).
(f)     Included a $30 charge  ($0.02 per share) to increase  net  deferred  tax
        liabilities  as of the  beginning of 1993 for a 1% statutory  income tax
        rate increase due to 1993 U.S. Federal tax legislation.
(g)     Included $193 ($129  after-tax or $0.08 per share) in unusual charges to
        reorganize and streamline worldwide beverages and certain  International
        snack foods operations.
(h)     Included increased postretirement benefits expense of $52 ($32 after-tax
        or $0.02  per  share)  as a result of  adopting  SFAS  106,  "Employers'
        Accounting for  Postretirement  Benefits Other Than Pensions."  Included
        the impact of adopting SFAS 109,  "Accounting  for Income  Taxes," which
        reduced pre-tax income by $21 and the provision for income taxes by $34.
(i)     Included  $170 in unusual  charges  ($120  after-tax or $0.07 per share)
        primarily to streamline  operations in worldwide  snack foods and KFC in
        the U.S.

PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(j)     Included $83 in unusual  charges ($49  after-tax or $0.03 per share) for
        costs  of  closing  restaurants,   U.S.  trade  receivables   exposures,
        accelerated  contributions to the PepsiCo  Foundation and a reduction in
        the  carrying  amount  of  an  unconsolidated  international  Pizza  Hut
        affiliate.
(k)     The $18 gain ($17  after-tax  or $0.01 per  share) in 1994  arose from a
        public share offering by BAESA, an  unconsolidated  franchised  bottling
        affiliate in South America. See Note 17. The $118 gain ($53 after-tax or
        $0.03 per share) in 1990 arose from an initial  public  offering  of new
        shares by an  unconsolidated  KFC joint  venture  in Japan and a sale by
        PepsiCo of a portion of its shares.
(l)     Represented  the  cumulative  effect  of  adopting  in  1994  SFAS  112,
        "Employers'  Accounting for Postemployment  Benefits," and changing to a
        preferable  method  for  calculating  the  market-related  value of plan
        assets  used in  determining  the  return-on-asset  component  of annual
        pension expense and the cumulative net unrecognized gain or loss subject
        to amortization (see Notes 13 and 15, respectively) and adopting in 1992
        SFAS 106 ($575 ($357  after-tax  or $0.22 per share)) and SFAS 109 ($571
        tax charge  ($0.35 per share)).  Prior years were not restated for these
        changes in accounting.
(m)     Defined as net cash  provided by  operating  activities  reduced by cash
        dividends  paid and adjusted  for the  following  investing  activities:
        capital spending, refranchising of restaurants, sales of property, plant
        and  equipment  and other,  net.  Cash flows  from other  investing  and
        financing activities,  which are not presented,  are an integral part of
        total cash flow activity.
(n)     See Net Income Per Share in Note 1.
(o)     Total debt includes  short-term  borrowings and long-term debt,  which 
        for 1987 through 1990 included a
        nonrecourse obligation.
(p)     The return on average  shareholders'  equity is calculated  using income
        from  continuing  operations  before  cumulative  effect  of  accounting
        changes.
(q)     The market net debt ratio  represents  net debt as a percent of net debt
        plus the market value of equity,  based on the year-end stock price. Net
        debt is total debt, which for this purpose includes the present value of
        long-term  operating  lease  commitments,   reduced  by  the  pro  forma
        remittance  of  investment  portfolios  held  outside the U.S.  For 1987
        through 1990, total debt was also reduced by the nonrecourse  obligation
        in the calculation of net debt.
(r)     The historical  cost net debt ratio  represents net debt (see (q) above)
        as a percent of capital employed (net debt, other liabilities,  deferred
        income taxes and shareholders' equity).

                                   Foreword

            The PepsiCo Long Term  Savings  Program  permits  eligible
employees  to defer  receipt  of a portion  of their  Eligible  Pay in
order to promote  savings on a  tax-favored  basis.  The Plan provides
for  distributions  in the event of termination of employment,  death,
or attainment of age 59-1/2.  In addition,  in certain  circumstances,
withdrawals are permitted in the event of hardship.
            The Plan has been  established  by PepsiCo,  Inc.  for the
benefit of its salaried  Employees  and certain  union  employees  and
certain  salaried,  commissioned  sales and hourly  Employees  of each
subsidiary  designated by PepsiCo,  Inc.  which adopts this Plan as an
Employer.
            The  PepsiCo  Long  Term  Savings  Program  was  initially
established   effective   January  1,  1983,   and  was   subsequently
amended.  Effective  December 31, 1991,  the  Kentucky  Fried  Chicken
Corporation  Long  Term  Savings  Program,  the  Pizza  Hut Long  Term
Savings Program,  the Pepsi-Cola  Operating  Company Long Term Savings
Program  and the Taco Bell  Long Term  Savings  Program  (the  "Merged
Plans") were merged into the PepsiCo  Long Term  Savings  Program (the
"Plan").  The Plan was amended and  restated  effective  July 1, 1992.
Except as otherwise  provided  herein,  this amendment and restatement
is  effective  as of  July 1, 1992,  and  applies to  persons  who are
Participants  in  the  Plan  on  or  after  that  date.  Except  as so
provided,  the  rights  and  benefits  with  respect  to  persons  who
terminated  participation  in the Plan or the  Merged  Plans  prior to
the date a  provision  is  effective  shall be  governed  by the prior
provisions  of the Plan  and the  Merged  Plans.  The  provisions  set
forth in the following  Articles apply to all  Participants  except to
the extent  otherwise  provided.  To  provide  for the  investment  of
contributions  to  this  Plan  and  other  tax-favored  savings  plans
maintained by it and its  subsidiaries and affiliates,  PepsiCo,  Inc.
has established the Master Trust described in Article X.

                           ARTICLE III
                  Eligibility and Participation
            3.1  Eligibility:  This  section,  as  modified by the
Appendix,  specifies  who is eligible to  participate  in the Plan
(the "eligible Employees").
                  (a)  General  Rule:   The  following   Employees
      shall be  eligible  to  participate  in the Plan if they are
      currently  eligible to enroll in their  Employer's  Benefits
      Plus  program:   All   full-time   and  part-time   salaried
      Employees   of  an  Employer  and  all   full-time   hourly,
      commissioned   sales  or  transportation   Employees  of  an
      Employer.
                  (b) Ineligible  Employees:  Notwithstanding  the
      general rule in (a) above,  the  following  Employees  shall
      not be eligible to participate in the Plan:
                        (1)   Any   Employee   whose   terms   and
            conditions of employment  are determined by collective
            bargaining with a union  representing such persons and
            with  respect to whom  inclusion  in this Plan has not
            been  specifically  provided  for in  such  collective
            bargaining agreement;
                        (2)   Any   Employee   who  is  a   leased
            employee within the meaning of Code section 414(n);
                        (3)  Effective   December  1,  1989,   any
            Highly  Compensated  Employee who has not attained age
            21 and completed a Year of Service;
                        (4) Any  individual  who is an independent
            contractor; and
                        (5)  Effective  on and  after  January  1,
            1996,  any Employee of an Employer  designated on Part
            1  of  the  attached   Schedule  3  who  is  a  Highly
            Compensated  Employee (or who is reasonably  projected
            to be a Highly Compensated  Employee based on the best
            available data).
      An  independent  contractor  who is  recharacterized  by the
      Internal  Revenue  Service as a common law employee will not
      be considered  described in paragraph (4) for periods on and
      after  the  recharacterization.  Such  individual  also will
      not be  considered  described in  paragraph  (4) for periods
      before  the  recharacterization,  unless  the  Employer  

                                       III-1
<PAGE>

     
      had classified the  individual as an  independent  contractor 
      in good faith, and the  individual  was  part  of a group  of
      independent   contractors   identified   by   similar   work
      requirements.   An  individual's   ineligibility  under  the
      previous  sentence  shall have no  bearing  on  whether  the
      individual  is an  excludable  employee  for purposes of the
      nondiscrimination  tests  under  Code  sections  410(b)  and
      401(a)(4).
                  (c)  Certain  Part-Time   Employees:   Effective
      July  1,  1995,  any  Employee  who  would  be  an  eligible
      Employee if he were  classified by his Employer as full-time
      (with no other  changes  in his  status  and  circumstances)
      shall be eligible to participate in the Plan.
For purposes of this  section,  an Employee  who is an  associate,
casual,  part-time or temporary  employee is not  considered to be
full-time.
            3.2  Participation:
                  (a)  Commencement  of Active  Participation:  An
      eligible  Employee shall become an Active  Participant  upon
      enrolling in the Plan.
                        (1) An eligible  Employee's  enrollment in
            the Plan shall be made by  electing to defer a portion
            of  his  Eligible  Pay,  in  accordance  with  Section
            4.1(b).  An eligible  Employee's  qualifying  election
            to   participate   actively   in  the  Plan  shall  be
            effective as soon as practicable for his Employer.
                        (2)  Notwithstanding  paragraph (1) above,
            the   election   of   an   Employee   eligible   under
            Section 3.1(c)  shall  not  be  effective  before  the
            first January 1 or July 1  following his attainment of
            age 21 and his  completion  of a  12-month  period  of
            employment  (measured as described  below) in which he
            is  credited  with at least  1,000  Hours  of  Service
            (referred  to as a  "year  of  eligibility  service").
            The  12-month  period  between  the date the  Employee
            first  completes  one Hour of  Service  and the  first
            anniversary   thereof  shall  be  used   initially  to
            determine his  eligibility to participate in the Plan;
            thereafter,  his  eligibility  to  participate  in the
            Plan shall be  determined  by  reference to whether he
            completes  1,000 or more  Hours of Service in any Plan
            Year,  beginning  with the first Plan

                                       III-2
<PAGE>

            
            Year  commencing after he first completes one  Hour  of  
            Service. An employee who completes 1,000 or more Hours  
            of Service in both the initial 12-month eligibility 
            computationperiod and the first  Plan Year   commencing  
            after he first  completes one Hour of Service shall be 
            credited with two years of eligibility service for
            purposes of this section.
            
                  (b)  Termination  of  Participation:  An  Active
      Participant  shall continue to  participate  actively in the
      Plan until he revokes his enrollment or his enrollment  ends
      as a result of his  Termination of Employment or transfer to
      a  position  that  is  ineligible  for  participation.  When
      active  participation  ceases,  an individual with a balance
      in  his  Plan   Account   shall   continue  as  an  Inactive
      Participant until his Account has been distributed.
                  (c)  Recommencement  of  Active   Participation:
      Subject  to  Section  3.3,  any   individual   whose  active
      participation has terminated  pursuant to subsection (b) may
      return   to  active   participation   by   reinstating   his
      enrollment  (following  his return to service as an eligible
      Employee, if applicable).
          3.3  Break in  Service:  This  section  shall  apply in the case of an
     Employee described in Section 3.1(c) who has a break in service, as defined
     below. In determining such Employee's post-break participation in the Plan,
     the Employee's  pre-break  years of  eligibility  service shall be restored
     only  after  he has a year of  eligibility  service  following  his  rehire
     (determined  under Section 3.2 as if his employment  first commenced on his
     date of rehire).  For purposes  hereof,  a "break in service"  shall mean a
     12-consecutive-month   computation  period  during  which  an  Employee  is
     credited  with 500 or less Hours of  Service.  The  applicable  computation
     period for  determining  breaks in  service  shall be the  12-month  period
     beginning on the Employee's date of employment and Plan Years commencing
     after such date of employment.

                            ARTICLE IV
                Contributions and Deferral Amounts

            4.1  Elective  Deferrals:  An Employee who is eligible
under  Section 3.1 and who has  Eligible  Pay may elect to defer a
portion  of his  Eligible  Pay in  accordance  with the  following
subsections.
                  (a)    Deferral    Amount:    Subject   to   the
      limitations   established  by  this  Article,   each  Active
      Participant  may  defer  in any Plan  Year up to 10  percent
      (15 percent,  effective January 1, 1996) of his Eligible Pay
      in   accordance   with   this   section.   In  the  event  a
      Participant  elects to defer a portion of his  Eligible  Pay
      under the Plan, it will be designated  for  contribution  by
      the Employer to the Trust on behalf of the Participant,  and
      for  deposit in his Salary  Deferral  Account.  All  amounts
      deposited to a Participant's  Salary Deferral  Account shall
      at all times be fully vested.
                  (b)  Election  to  Defer:   Each   Employee  who
      qualifies  as an  eligible  Employee  under  Section 3.1 may
      elect to defer a portion of his Eligible  Pay in  accordance
      with  subsection  (d). An eligible  Employee shall make this
      election by:
                        (1)    Completing    and   returning   the
            enrollment    form,   or   utilizing   the   telephone
            enrollment    system,    provided    by    the    Plan
            Administrator,
                        (2)   Designating   a   portion   of   his
            Eligible Pay to be  contributed by his Employer to the
            Plan, and
                        (3)  Indicating  how such  amounts  are to
            be invested under Section 5.2.
      An eligible  Employee's election under this subsection shall
      be  effective  as soon as  practicable  for his Employer and
      shall  remain in effect  until it is modified or  terminated
      under   subsection   (c)   below,   or  until   his   active
      participation terminates in accordance with Section 3.2(b).
                  (c)  Changes in  Deferral  Election:  Subject to
      subsection   (d),  an  Active   Participant   may  elect  to
      increase,  decrease or terminate  the amount of his deferral
      at any

                                       
<PAGE>

      time by completing  and returning a change of election form,
      or using the  telephone  enrollment  system to designate the
      revised  deferral  rate to be  contributed  to the  Plan.  A
      Participant's   election  under  this  subsection  shall  be
      effective as soon as practicable for his Employer.
                  (d) Election  Procedures:  To be  effective,  an
      election made  pursuant to subsection  (b) or (c) above must
      be made in the manner  specified by the Plan  Administrator.
      In addition,  the election  shall  specify the amount of the
      deferral  desired  for each Plan Year in the form of a whole
      dollar   amount,   a  percentage   of  Eligible  Pay,  or  a
      combination   of  the   two  as   specified   by  the   Plan
      Administrator  from time to time  (effective  prior to 1996,
      only the  whole  dollar  amount  form  shall be  available),
      subject to the  limitation  in  subsection  (a)  above.  Any
      election   purporting   to  defer  more  than  the   maximum
      percentage  of Eligible Pay permitted  under  subsection (a)
      shall  be  treated  as an  election  to defer  such  maximum
      percentage  of Eligible Pay.  Notwithstanding  the preceding
      sentence,  the Plan  Administrator  shall not give effect to
      elections  that  do  not  meet  the  minimum  standards  for
      completeness    and   accuracy   the   Plan    Administrator
      establishes from time to time.
                  (e)   Payroll   Deductions:    A   Participant's
      Salary  Deferral  Contributions  shall be withheld  from his
      Eligible  Pay  through  automatic  payroll  deductions.  The
      amount to be withheld  in any pay period  shall be a ratable
      share  of  the  Participant's   currently  effective  salary
      deferral   election   for  the  entire  Plan  Year.   Salary
      Deferral  Contributions  may not be withheld after they have
      been actually or constructively received by the Participant.
            4.2    Dollar    Limits   on    Elective    Deferrals:
Notwithstanding  Section 4.1, a Participant's  Elective  Deferrals
shall be limited as provided in this section.
                  (a)  Initial   Limit:   Effective  for  calendar
      years   beginning   on  and  after   January  1,   1987,   a
      Participant's  Elective  Deferrals  under the Plan  shall be
      limited to $7,000 or, if  greater,  the  adjusted  amount in
      effect under Code section 402(g) for the preceding  calendar
      year.
                  (b)   Additional   Limit:   Effective  for  Plan
      Years  beginning   after  1987,  a  Participant's   Elective
      Deferrals,  which are made in any calendar  year to the Plan
      or any


                                       IV-2
<PAGE>

                                    
      other  arrangement  maintained by the Employer,  shall be limited to
      the amount  permissible  under Code section 402(g) for taxable years
      beginning in such calendar year.
                  (c)  Distribution of Excess Elective Deferral:
                        (1)  Assignment:  If the  Elective  Deferral  made
            on behalf  of a  Participant  under  all  plans in which  such
            individual  is a  participant,  whether or not  maintained  by
            the  Employer,  exceeds  the dollar  limitation  contained  in
            Code  section  402(g),  such  Participant  may  assign to this
            Plan any Excess  Elective  Deferral made during a taxable year
            of the  Participant  no later than March 1 following the close
            of,  and with  respect  to,  the  taxable  year in which  such
            Excess Elective Deferral was made by:
                              (i)  Notifying  the  Plan  Administrator  in
                  writing  of the  Elective  Deferral  made under any plan
                  other than this Plan,
                              (ii)   Allocating  in  writing  such  Excess
                  Elective  Deferral  between or among  such  other  plans
                  and this Plan, and
                              (iii) Stating  in   writing   that  if  such
                  Excess  Elective  Deferral  allocable to the Plan is not
                  distributed,  the deferral  limitations  of Code section
                  402(g) will be exceeded  for the  Participant's  taxable
                  year  with  respect  to  which  such  Elective  Deferral
                  occurred.
                        (2)    Distribution:    Upon    notification    in
            accordance with  paragraph (1),  the Plan Administrator  shall
            distribute  any  Excess  Elective  Deferral  allocated  to the
            Plan (plus any income  and minus any loss  allocable  thereto)
            to the  relevant  Participant  no later  than  April 15 of the
            calendar  year  following the close of the taxable year of the
            Participant   with  respect  to  which  such  Excess  Elective
            Deferral was made.
                    (3)   Determination  of  Income  or  Loss:  Excess  Elective
               Deferrals  shall be adjusted  for any income or loss  through the
               end of the taxable year of the Participant  with respect to which
               such  Excess  Elective  Deferral  was

                                           IV-3
<PAGE>


               made. The income or loss allocable to a Participant's Excess
               Elective  Deferral  is  the  income  or  loss  allocable  to  the
               Participant's  Salary  Deferral  Account for such  taxable  year,
               multiplied  by  a  fraction,   the  numerator  of  which  is  the
               Participant's Excess Elective Deferrals for such taxable year and
               the  denominator of which is the  Participant's  account  balance
               attributable  to Salary Deferral  Contributions  as of the end of
               the taxable year without  regard to any income or loss  occurring
               during such taxable year.
                  To  the  extent  necessary  to  ensure  compliance  with
      subsection  (b)  above,  the  Plan  Administrator  shall  distribute
      Excess  Elective  Deferrals to a  Participant,  notwithstanding  the
      fact that the  Participant  has not  assigned  such Excess  Elective
      Deferrals  to this  Plan by the  deadline  specified  in  subsection
      (c)(1).  Such  distribution  shall be  accomplished  as contemplated
      in subsection (c)(2) above.
            4.3  Limitation on Deferral Percentage:
                  (a)  Limitation:   Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to
      the  contrary,  in any Plan Year  beginning  on or after  January 1,
      1987,  the Average  Deferral  Percentage  of the eligible  Employees
      who are Highly  Compensated  Employees  for such Plan Year shall not
      exceed the greater of (1) or (2) below:
                        (1)  The  Average   Deferral   Percentage  of  the
            eligible  Employees who are Non-Highly  Compensated  Employees
            for such Plan Year multiplied by 1.25, or
                        (2)  The  Average   Deferral   Percentage  of  the
            eligible  Employees who are Non-Highly  Compensated  Employees
            for such  Plan  Year  multiplied  by 2.0,  provided,  however,
            that in this  case  the  Average  Deferral  Percentage  of the
            eligible  Employees  who  are  Highly  Compensated   Employees
            shall  not  exceed  the  Average  Deferral  Percentage  of the
            eligible  Employees who are Non-Highly  Compensated  Employees
            by more than 2 percentage points.

                  (b)  Average  Deferral   Percentage:   For  purposes  of
      subsection  (a)  above,  the  Average  Deferral   Percentage  for  a
      specified  group  of  Employees  for a  Plan  Year  shall  mean  the
      average of the ratios  (calculated  separately for each  Participant
      in such group) of:
                              (1)  The  amount  of  the  Salary  Deferrals
                  made  on  behalf  of the  Employee  for  the  Plan  Year
                  (including   Excess   Elective   Deferrals   of   Highly
                  Compensated Employees), to
                              (2)  The  Employee's  compensation  for  the
                  Plan  Year   (whether   or  not  the   Employee   was  a
                  Participant for the entire Plan Year).
            For Plan Years  beginning  on or after  January  1, 1989,  the
            Average  Deferral  Percentage shall be computed to the nearest
            one hundredth of one percent.
                        (c)  Special  Rules:  In  applying  the limits set
            forth in  subsection  (a) above,  the  following  rules  shall
            apply:
                              (1)  For   purposes   of  this   subsection,
                  compensation  means  compensation  as  defined  in  Code
                  section   414(s).   For  Plan  Years  in  which   Excess
                  Contributions  and Income are  distributed  pursuant  to
                  subsection  (e),   compensation  means  compensation  as
                  defined  in  Treas.  Reg.  1.415-2(d)(11)(ii).  For Plan
                  Years   beginning   on  or  after   January   1,   1989,
                  compensation  shall be limited to $200,000  (adjusted at
                  the same  time and in such  manner  as  permitted  under
                  Code  section  415(d))  provided  that  for  Plan  Years
                  beginning on or after January 1, 1994,  compensation  is
                  limited to  $150,000  (adjusted  at the same time and in
                  such manner as permitted under Code section 415(d)).
                              (2)  If a  Highly  Compensated  Employee  is
                  eligible  to  participate  under  more  than one cash or
                  deferred  arrangement  described in Code section  401(k)
                  maintained  by the  Employer,  all such cash or deferred
                  arrangements  shall be  treated as one for  purposes  of
                  calculating    such    Employee's    Average    Deferral
                  Percentage.
                              (3)  For   purposes   of   determining   the
                  Deferral  Percentage  of a Highly  Compensated  Employee
                  who  is  a 5  percent  owner  or  one  of  the  10

                  most highly-paid Highly Compensated  Employees, as described
                  in    Section    2.1(t)(5),    the    Salary    Deferral
                  Contributions  and  compensation  of such Employee shall
                  include   the   Salary   Deferral    Contributions   and
                  compensation   for  the   Plan   Year  of  such   Highly
                  Compensated  Employee's Family Members,  as described in
                  Code section  414(q)(6).  Family  Members,  with respect
                  to  such   Highly   Compensated   Employees,   shall  be
                  disregarded  as separate  Employees in  determining  the
                  Average   Deferral    Percentage   both   for   eligible
                  Employees who are Non-Highly  Compensated  Employees and
                  for  eligible   Employees  who  are  Highly  Compensated
                  Employees.
                  (d)  Adjustment  of Salary  Deferrals:  If during a Plan
      Year the Plan  Administrator  determines  that there is a likelihood
      that the  Average  Deferral  Percentage  of the  Highly  Compensated
      Employees  will exceed the limitation  specified in subsection  (a),
      then the Plan  Administrator may  prospectively  reduce or limit the
      deferrals  of the Highly  Compensated  Employees  to such amount and
      beginning  as of such pay  period  during the Plan Year as is deemed
      necessary  by the  Plan  Administrator  in its  sole  discretion  to
      prevent the  limitation  in subsection  (a) from being  exceeded for
      the Plan Year.  The Plan  Administrator  may  terminate (in whole or
      in part)  any  reduction  or  limitation  on  deferrals  under  this
      subsection  which is no longer  necessary to prevent the  limitation
      specified  in  subsection  (a)  from  being  exceeded  for the  Plan
      Year.   Whenever   necessary   during  the  Plan   Year,   the  Plan
      Administrator  may institute  further  reductions or  limitations on
      deferrals,  or reinstate reductions or limitations on deferrals,  to
      the extent  required to prevent the  limitation  in  subsection  (a)
      from being exceeded.
                  (e)  Distribution  of Excess  Contributions  and Income:
      If the Average  Deferral  Percentage  of the eligible  Employees who
      are  Highly   Compensated   Employees  exceeds  the  limitations  of
      subsection  (a) for any Plan Year,  then  notwithstanding  any other
      provision of the Plan, any Excess  Contributions  for such Plan Year
      
                                       IV-6

<PAGE>

      (plus any  income  and minus any loss  allocable  thereto)  shall be
      distributed to the  appropriate  Highly  Compensated  Employees and,
      where  applicable,  family members,  not later than two and one-half
      months  following  the Plan Year with  respect to which such  Excess
      Contributions were made.
                        (1)   Determination  of  Income  or  Loss:  Excess
            Contributions  shall  be  adjusted  for  any  income  or  loss
            through  the  end  of the  Plan  Year  for  which  the  Excess
            Contributions  occurred.  The  income or loss  allocable  to a
            Participant's Excess Elective Deferral shall be as follows:
                              (i) For the  Plan  Year  beginning  in 1987,
                  the Employer  may use any  reasonable  and  consistently
                  applied  method for  computing  the income  allocable to
                  any Excess Contributions for such Plan Year.
                              (ii) For Plan  Years  beginning  on or after
                  January  1,  1988,  the  income  or  loss  allocable  to
                  Excess  Contributions  is the  income or loss  allocable
                  to the  Participant's  Salary  Deferral  Account for the
                  Plan Year for which the  Excess  Contributions  occurred
                  multiplied  by a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which is
                  the  Participant's  Excess  Contributions  for such Plan
                  Year and the  denominator of which is the  Participant's
                  account   balance   attributable   to  Salary   Deferral
                  Contributions  as of the end of the  Plan  Year  without
                  regard  to any  income  or loss  occurring  during  such
                  Plan Year.
                        (2)  Special Rules:
                              (i)  In  the  event   family   members   are
                  aggregated  for purposes of this section,  distributions
                  to  such  family  members  of any  Excess  Contributions
                  shall  be  made  in  the   manner   prescribed   by  the
                  regulations under Code section 401(k).
                              (ii)    Any     distribution    of    Excess
                  Contributions  and  income  thereon  shall  be  made  to
                  Highly Compensated Employees on the basis of the re-

                                       IV-7
<PAGE>

                  spective  portions  of the  total  Excess  Contributions
                  attributable to each such Employee.
                              (iii)    Any    distribution    of    Excess
                  Contributions  and income  thereon may and shall be made
                  without  regard  to any  other  provision  of this  Plan
                  restricting distributions.
                  (f)     Determination     By     Plan     Administrator:
      Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions  of  this  section,  any
      determination  required  by this  section  shall be made by the Plan
      Administrator,  and the determination by such Plan  Administrator of
      the  method of  compliance  with  subsection  (a) and  reduction  of
      deferrals  in  excess  of  that  permitted  by  subsection  (a),  in
      accordance  with  subsection  (d),  and  the  determination  of  any
      Excess  Contribution  to be distributed  pursuant to subsection (e),
      shall be final,  binding,  and  conclusive  as to all  Participants,
      former Participants,  Beneficiaries,  and any other person or entity
      associated with or benefiting from this Plan.
                  (g) Priority of  Application  of  Sections:  Section 4.2
      shall be applied before this section.
            4.4   Rollover   Contributions:    At   the   request   of   a
Participant,  a Retired  Employee  or an Employee  who is  eligible  under
Section  3.1 (or could be upon the  completion  of any  requirements  with
respect  to age or  service),  the Plan  may  accept  a  rollover  of cash
amounts from another  qualified  plan  described in section  401(a) of the
Code,  including an individual  retirement account or annuity whose assets
came  solely  from a  qualified  plan.  Any such  rollover  amount will be
held for the Participant,  Employee,  or Retired Employee, as the case may
be, in a  Rollover  Account  established  for his  benefit.  A person  who
makes such a rollover  contribution  to the Plan, but who is not otherwise
eligible to make (or who chooses  not to make) a deferral  election  under
Section  4.1(b),  shall be  considered an Inactive  Participant.  The Plan
Administrator  and the  Trustee  may  request  such  information  from the
Participant,  Employee,  or  Retired  Employee,  as the case  may be,  any
documents  or  opinion  of  counsel  which  it, in its  discretion,  deems
necessary  to  determine  that a  proper  rollover  

                                       IV-8

<PAGE>

contribution  will be made.  Amounts in a Rollover  Account shall be invested as
designated by the  Participant  pursuant to Section  5.2(c).  The amounts in the
Rollover Account shall be distributed at the same time and in the same manner as
amounts in the Salary Deferral Account.
            4.5  Maximum Allocations:
                  (a) The  amount  of  Annual  Additions  (as  defined  in
      subsection  (d)  below)  which may be  credited  to the  Participant
      under  this Plan  during  any  Limitation  Year shall not exceed the
      lesser  of  $30,000  (or,  if  greater,  one-fourth  of the  defined
      benefits  dollar  limitation set forth in Code section  415(b)(1) as
      in  effect  for the  Limitation  Year)  or 25% of the  Participant's
      Annual  Compensation  (as defined in  subsection  (e) below) for the
      applicable Limitation Year.
                  (b)  For  any  Participant  in the  Plan  who is  also a
      participant  in one or more  defined  benefit  plans (as  defined in
      section  414(j) of the Code)  maintained  by the  Company  or by the
      Employer,  the sum of the  fractions in (1) and (2) below,  computed
      as of the close of the  Limitation  Year,  may not exceed 1.0, where
      the fractions are determined as follows:
                        (1) The  Projected  Annual  Benefit (as defined in
            subsection  (d) below) of the  Participant  under such defined
            benefit plans, divided by the lesser of:
                              (i) the  product  of the  dollar  limitation
                  determined for the  Limitation  Year under Code sections
                  415(b) and (d)  multiplied  by 1.25 (or 1.0, if the Plan
                  is a Top-Heavy Plan, as defined by Section 14.2(c)), or
                              (ii)  140   percent  of  the   Participant's
                  Average  Compensation  (as  defined  in  subsection  (d)
                  below),  including  any  adjustments  under Code section
                  415(b) plus
                        (2)  The  sum  of  the  Annual  Addition  to  such
            Participant's  accounts  under this Plan and all other defined
            contribution   plans  maintained  by  
                                       IV-9
<PAGE>

     the Employer for such  Limitation  Year and for all Prior Years (as defined
in  subsection  (d) below)  divided  by the sum of the  lesser of the  following
amounts  determined  for such Plan Year and all Prior Years:  

                    (i)  the  product of the Dollar  Limitation  (as  defined in
                         subsection (d) below) in effect for the year multiplied
                         by 1.25 (or 1.0,  if the Plan is a Top-Heavy  Plan,  as
                         defined by Section 14.2(c)), or
                    (ii) 35 percent of the Participant's Annual Compensation for
                         the year.
                  (c) In the event that a  Participant's  Annual  Addition
      under this Plan,  when added to the Annual  Addition under any other
      defined  contribution  plan (as  defined  in  section  414(i) of the
      Code) or the  Projected  Annual  Benefit  under any defined  benefit
      plan maintained by the Employer,  exceeds the limitations  specified
      in Section  4.5(a) or (b),  appropriate  reductions  in such  Annual
      Addition  or  Projected   Annual   Benefit  shall  be  made  in  the
      following order:
                        (1)  First,  under  any  defined  benefit  plan(s)
            maintained by the Employer,
                        (2)  To  the  extent  that  additional  reductions
            are still necessary, under this Plan, and
                        (3)   To   the   extent   that   any    additional
            reductions  are  still  necessary,  under a  PepsiCo  employee
            stock ownership plan.
                  (d) For  purposes of this  Section  4.5,  the  following
      definitions and rules of interpretation shall apply:
                        (1)   Effective   for   years    beginning   after
            December 31,  1986,  the "Annual  Addition"  of a  Participant
            means the sum  credited  to a  Participant's  account  for any
            year   of   (i)   employer   contributions;    (ii)   employee
            contributions;  (iii)  forfeitures and (iv) amounts  described
            in Code  sections  415(l)(2) and  419A(d)(2).  Notwithstanding
            the foregoing,  for years  beginning prior to 

                                       IV-10

<PAGE>

          January 1, 1987,  only that  portion of the  employee's  contributions
          equal to the lesser of: (A) the portion of his employee  contributions
          (if any)  during  such  year in  excess  of 6  percent  of his  annual
          compensation,  or (B)  one-half of his employee  contributions  during
          such plan year shall be  considered an "Annual  Addition."  The Annual
          Addition for any year beginning prior to January 1, 1987, shall not be
          recomputed to treat all employee  contributions as an Annual Addition.
        
         (2) "Projected Annual Benefit" means the Annual Benefit (as defined in
          paragraph (3) below) to which a Participant  would be entitled under a
          defined  benefit plan (after giving  effect to any  limitation on such
          benefit  contained  in  such  plan  that  may  be  applicable  to  the
          Participant) on the assumptions that he continues employment until his
          Normal Retirement Date thereunder,  that his compensation continues at
          the same rate as in effect for the Limitation Year under consideration
          until such Normal Retirement Date, and that all other relevant factors
          used to  determine  benefits  under such plan remain  constant for all
          future Limitation Years.

          (3) The "Annual  Benefit"  of a  Participant  means the annual  amount
          payable under a defined  benefit plan computed in accordance  with the
          following rules:
                              (i)  Where  the   Annual   Benefit   payable
                  under a defined  benefit  plan is other than in the form
                  of either a single  life  annuity or a  qualified  joint
                  and  survivor   annuity   within  the  meaning  of  Code
                  section  417(b)  it shall be  adjusted  to an  actuarial
                  equivalent   benefit  in  the  form  of  a  single  life
                  annuity.
                              (ii)  In  the  case  of a  benefit  under  a
                  defined   benefit   plan  which   begins  prior  to  the
                  Participant's Social Security Retirement Age
                  (as defined  below),  such benefit  shall be adjusted so
                  that it is the
                                        IV-11
<PAGE>

                  actuarial  equivalent  of a  benefit  commencing  at the
                  Participant's   Social   Security   Retirement  Age  for
                  purposes  of applying  the Code  section  415(b)  dollar
                  maximum.
                              (iii)  In the  case  of a  benefit  under  a
                  defined    benefit   plan   which   begins   after   the
                  Participant's   Social  Security  Retirement  Age,  such
                  benefit  shall be adjusted to the  actuarial  equivalent
                  of a  benefit  commencing  at the  Participant's  Social
                  Security  Retirement  Age for  purposes of applying  the
                  Code section 415(b) dollar maximum.
                              (iv) For years  beginning  prior to  January
                  1,   1987,   subparagraph   (B)  shall  be   applied  by
                  substituting  "age  62" for  "the  Participant's  Social
                  Security  Retirement  Age," and  subparagraph  (C) shall
                  be   applied   by   substituting   "age   65"  for  "the

            years of employment for  Participants  employed by an Employer
            less than 3 consecutive  years)  during which the  Participant

            current  Limitation  Year, in which the Participant was in the

            sentence,  "year"  shall  mean (in the  event  the Plan was in
            existence  during  such year) a  Limitation  Year,  or (in the
            event the Plan was not in  existence  during  such year) a 12-
            month  period  which  begins and ends on the same dates as the
            Limitation Year.
                        (6)  "Dollar   Limitation"  means  the  limitation
            provided   in   Code   section   415(c)(1)(A)   (adjusted   in

            effect for the particular Plan Year.

            age 62 after December 31, 2016.
                        (8) For  purposes of Section  4.5(b)(1)(i)  above,
            if as of the last Plan Year ending  before  January 1, 1983, a
            Participant's  accrued  benefit (within the meaning of Section

            1982) under the  Employer's  defined  benefit plans is greater
            than  $90,000  (and  also  such  other  amount  as  may  apply
            pursuant to  automatic  adjustments  of the  $90,000  figure),
            then  Section  4.5(b)(1)(i)  shall be applied by  substituting
            such accrued benefit for $90,000 where it appears therein.
                        (9)  For   purposes  of   computing   the  maximum
            allocation  under  either  subsection  (a) or (b), all defined
            benefit  plans  (whether or not  terminated)  of the  Employer
            shall  be  treated  as  one  defined  benefit  plan,  and  all
            defined  contribution  plans  (whether or not  terminated)  of
            the  Employer  shall be  treated as one  defined  contribution
            plan.
                        (10)  When  the  term  "Employer"  is used in this
            section,   it  shall   mean  the   Employer   and  any   other
            corporation  or  division  which is a member  of a  controlled

                  actually  rendered in the course of employment  with the
                  Employer  maintaining  the plan to the  extent  that the
                  amounts are includable in gross income  (including,  but
                  not   limited    to,    commissions    paid    salesmen,
                  compensation  for  services on the basis of a percentage

                  and  bonuses,  fringe  benefits,   reimbursements,   and
                  expense allowances);
                              (ii)  Amounts  described  in  Code  sections

                  Employer   for   moving    expenses    incurred   by   a

                  are  not  deductible  by  the  Participant   under  Code
                  section 217;
                              (iv)  The  value  of a  non-qualified  stock
                  option  granted  to  a  Participant,  but  only  to  the

                  Participant's  gross  income  for  the  taxable  year in
                  which  contributed  or  Employer  contributions  under a
                  simplified  employee  pension  plan to the  extent  such
                  contributions are

                  from a plan of deferred compensation;
                              (ii)  Amounts  realized  from  the  exercise
                  of a  non-qualified  stock  option,  or when  restricted
                  stock  (or  property)  held  by the  Participant  either
                  becomes freely  transferable  or is no longer subject to
                  a substantial risk of forfeiture;
                              (iii)   Amounts   realized  from  the  sale,
                  exchange or other  disposition  of stock  acquired under
                  a qualified stock option; and
                              (iv) Other  amounts which  received  special
                  tax  benefits,  or  contributions  made by the  Employer
                  (whether  or not  under a  salary  reduction  agreement)
                  towards  the   purchase  of  an  annuity   described  in
                  section  403(b) of the Code  (whether or not the amounts
                  are  actually  excludable  from the gross  income of the
                  Participant).
                        Compensation   for  any  limitation  year  is  the
            compensation  actually  paid or  includable  in  gross  income
            during such year.
            4.6 Excess  Allocations:  If  pursuant  to  Section  4.5 there
is  an  excess  Annual   Addition  under  this  Plan  with  respect  to  a
Participant  for a Limitation  Year,  such excess Annual Addition shall be
disposed  of  by  distributing  to  the  Participant  such   Participant's

thereon) to the extent necessary to eliminate such excess.
            4.7 Fund for  Exclusive  Benefit  of  Participants:  Except as
otherwise  provided   hereinafter  (i)  all  assets  of  the  Trust  Fund,
including  investment income,  shall be retained for the exclusive benefit
of Participants  and  Beneficiaries,  and shall be used to pay benefits to
such  persons or to pay  administrative  expenses of the Plan and Trust to
the extent not paid by the Employer,  and (ii)  contributions  made by the
Employer  may not  under  any  circumstances  revert  to or  inure  to the
benefit  of  the  Employer;  except  that,  and  notwithstanding  anything
contained herein to the contrary,  contributions  (a) made by the Employer
by mistake  of fact,  or (b)  conditioned  upon the  deductibility  of the
contribution  under Code  section  404,  shall be returned to the Employer
within  1  year  of  the  mistaken  payment  or  the  disallowance  of the
deduction  (to the  extent  disallowed),  whichever  is  applicable.  Each
contribution   by  the  Employer  is  expressly  made  contingent  on  the
deductibility  of such  contribution  for the year with  respect  to which
the contribution is made.

                        Interests of Participants

     5.1 Accounts of Participants:  The Plan Administrator,  or its agent, shall
maintain separate  accounts on its books, for  recordkeeping  purposes only, for
each  Participant.  A given  Participant  may have two  accounts if he has:  (i)
deferred a percentage of his Eligible Pay pursuant to Section 4.1, and (ii) made
a  rollover  contribution  pursuant  to Section  4.4,  i.e.,  a Salary  Deferral
Account,  and a Rollover Account. The maintenance of individual accounts is only
for  accounting  purposes,  and a segregation of the assets of the Trust Fund to
each account shall not be required  (except as the Trustee deems necessary under
the  Brokerage  Option).  Distributions  and  withdrawals  from a  Participant's
Account shall be charged to the appropriate  account at the time the transaction
is processed.
     5.2 Investment of Participant  Accounts:  The investment  options under the
Plan are described in subsection  (a),  subject to the  limitations set forth in
subsection (b) and other provisions of the Plan.
                  (a)  Investment Options:      In  accordance   with  the
      rules provided in subsection  (c) below, a Participant  shall direct
      the  investment  of the  amounts  credited  to his Account to any of
      the  following  separate  investment  options  within the Trust Fund
      for which he is eligible at the time:
                        (1)  The  Security  Plus  Fund:   This   investment
            option,  available  effective January 1, 1992, is an investment
            portfolio  comprised of investment  funds and contracts  issued
            by highly rated banks and insurance  companies  and  short-term
            securities.  The  objective  of the Fund is to provide,  over a
            period of time,  a higher  rate of return  than  average  money
            market  funds,   while   preserving   principal  and  providing
            liquidity.  The Fund's  rate of return  will  fluctuate  and is
            not  intended  to  provide a  guaranteed  rate of  return.  The
            Participant's  interest  in the  fund  will be  denominated  as
            "units".  The  value  of a unit in  this  Fund  will be  $1.00.
            The number of units  credited to a Participant  will  fluctuate
            based upon the
                                       V-1
<PAGE>

     performance of the Fund. As of January 1, 1992, two 1991 Guaranteed  Income
Fund  contracts,  both issued by  Metropolitan  Life,  were  transferred  to the
Security Plus Fund. In addition to the  transferred  investment  contracts,  the
Fund is  expected  to invest  primarily  in:  (A)  short-term  investment  funds
(including  government  short-term investment funds) that invest in certificates
of deposit, time deposits, bankers' acceptances, commercial paper, U.S. Treasury
and agency  securities,  and mortgage and asset-backed  securities;  and (B) new
investment  contracts  issued by highly-rated  insurance  companies,  banks, and
other  financial  institutions.  The transfer of funds  invested in the Security
Plus Fund to other  separate  investment  options within the Trust Fund shall be
subject to the following restrictions:
                              (i)  No  amounts  invested  in  the  Security
                  Plus Fund may be  transferred  by a Participant  directly
                  to the  Brokerage  Option.  No  amounts  invested  in the
                  Security  Plus Fund may be  transferred  by a Participant
                  indirectly  to  the  Brokerage  Option,  i.e.,  by  first
                  transferring   the  amounts  to  some  other   investment
                  option (or options)  under the Plan,  unless such amounts
                  remain  invested  in the  intervening  investment  option
                  (or options) for at least 3 months;
                              (ii)  A  Participant  can  transfer   amounts
                  from the  Security  Plus Fund into some other  investment
                  option  (or  options)  under  the  Plan no  more  than 12
                  times during the Plan Year; and
                              (iii) Withdrawals  of  amounts   invested  in
                  the  Security  Plus Fund are  subject to the  limitations
                  specified in Section 6.3(c).
                        (2)  The  Equity  Index  Fund:   This   investment
            option is a  diversified  stock fund,  invested  primarily  in
            the  Vanguard  Institutional  Index  Fund.  It is a  passively
            managed fund  designed to mirror the  performance  of Standard
            and  Poor's  500  Index,  a  broadly-based  average  of  stock
            market

            performance.  Investments  in this  investment  option
            are  subject to  fluctuations,  and there is no  guarantee  of
            future  performance.  The  Participant's  interest in the Fund
            will be  denominated  as "units".  The value of a unit in this
            Fund  will  fluctuate  based on the  performance  of the Fund.
            The  number  of  units  credited  to a  Participant  will  not
            fluctuate based upon the performance of the Fund.
                        (3)  The   Equity-Income   Fund:   This   Fund  is
            primarily invested in the Fidelity  Equity-Income  Fund, which
            invests  primarily  in  income-producing  stocks.  The  Fund's
            chief  objective  is to provide  reasonable  income,  although
            some   consideration   is  given  to   capital   appreciation.
            Amounts  invested  in this  investment  option are  subject to
            fluctuations,   and   there   is  no   guarantee   of   future
            performance.  The  Participant's  interest in the Fund will be
            denominated  as  "units".  The  value  of a unit in this  Fund
            will  fluctuate  based on the  performance  of the  Fund.  The
            number of units  credited to a Participant  will not fluctuate
            based  upon  the  performance  of  the  Fund.  Notwithstanding
            anything  to the  contrary  herein,  if  with  respect  to any
            calendar   quarter    ("quarter")    Fidelity    Institutional
            Retirement  Services  Company makes a payment  pursuant to its
            Plan Expense  Reimbursement  Agreement with the Company,  such
            payment  shall be allocated to certain  Participants  who have
            an  interest in the Equity  Income Fund as provided  in (i) or
            (ii) below, as applicable.
                              (i)  Effective  for any  such  payment  made
                  with  respect  to a  quarter  beginning  after  June 30,
                  1996,  the  projected  amount  payable  with  respect to
                  each  business day in a quarter  shall be allocated on a
                  daily  basis  to  Participants  in  proportion  to their
                  interest  in the  Fund  on  such  business  day.  If the
                  actual  amount of  payment  for a quarter  differs  from
                  the  projected  amount   allocated,   then  as  soon  as
                  practicable   after  the  actual   payment  is  received
                  appropriate   adjustments   will  be  made  in  affected
                  Participants' Accounts that remain in the Plan.
                              (ii)  Any such  payment  made  with  respect
                  to  an   earlier   quarter   shall   be   allocated   to
                  Participants  who have an interest in the  
                                       V-3
<PAGE>

     Equity-Income  Fund on the last  business day of such quarter in proportion
to their interest in the Fund on such date.
     For  purposes  of (i) and  (ii)  above,  a  Participant's  interest  in the
Equity-Income  Fund on a day shall be determined before  adjustments in Accounts
are made for that day in accordance with Section 5.3.
                        (4)  The  PepsiCo   Capital   Stock   Fund:   This
            investment  option is  invested  primarily  in Company  Stock.
            Earnings  will  be  applied   primarily  to  the  purchase  of
            additional  shares of  Company  Stock.  The  objective  of the
            Fund  is  to   parallel   the  total   return   (stock   price
            appreciation/depreciation  plus  dividends) of Company  Stock.
            Amounts  invested  in this  investment  option are  subject to
            fluctuations,   and   there   is  no   guarantee   of   future
            performance.
                        A  Participant's  interest  in the  Fund  will  be
            denominated  as "units".  The  initial  value of a unit (as of
            February 29, 1992) in this Fund is $10.00 and  thereafter  the
            value  of  a  unit  will  fluctuate  in  response  to  various
            factors  including,  but not  limited  to,  the  price  of and
            dividends  paid on  Company  Stock,  earnings  and  losses  on
            other  investments  in the Fund, the mix of assets in the Fund
            and  Fund  expenses.   The  number  of  units  credited  to  a
            Participant's  account  will  not  fluctuate  based  upon  the
            performance  of the Fund.  Shares  of  PepsiCo  Capital  Stock
            held in the Fund and  dividends  and  other  distributions  on
            PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  are  not  specifically  allocated  to
            Participant  accounts.  Each  Participant's  investment in the
            PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  Fund will be based on the  proportion
            of his  investment in the Fund to the total  investment in the
            Fund of all Plan Participants.
                        All  dividends  on shares of Company  Stock in the
            Fund are paid to the  Fund.  Dividends  on  these  shares  are
            added to the Fund  without the  purchase of  additional  units
            in the Fund.  The  Trustee  shall use the  dividend  income to
            purchase  additional  shares of Company  Stock for the Fund or
            to meet  the cash  demands  of the  Fund.  Any  Company  Stock
            received by the Trustee as a stock  split or  dividend,  or as
            a result  of a  reorganization  or other  recapitalization  of
            PepsiCo,  will be added to the  assets of the Fund.  Any other
            property  (other  than  shares of 

                                       V-4
<PAGE>

     Company  Stock)  received by the Trustee may be sold by the Trustee and the
proceeds  added to the Fund.  Any rights to  subscribe to  additional  shares of
Company  Stock  shall be sold by the Trustee  and the  proceeds  credited to the
Fund.
                        Participants  who  have  invested  in the Fund may
            direct the  Trustee  how to vote (or  tender,  if  applicable)
            Company    Stock.    The   Trustee   will    determine    each
            Participant's  proportional  share of the Company Stock in the
            Fund  (based  on  the  number  of  units   allocated   to  the
            Participant's   Accounts)   and  solicit   the   Participant's
            instructions.  The Trustee  shall vote  (and/or  tender)  this
            stock   according  to  the   Participant's   directions.   The
            Trustee  shall  not vote  stock in the Fund for  which it does
            not receive directions.
                        The   Company   shall   assist   the   Trustee  in
            furnishing  Participants  investing  in  the  PepsiCo  Capital
            Stock  Fund with  proxy  materials,  notices  and  information
            statements  at the time  voting  rights  are to be  exercised.
            In general,  the materials to be furnished  Participants shall
            be the same as those provided to security holders.
                        Shares of  Company  Stock  will be  purchased  for
            the  Fund  in  the  open  market  or in  privately  negotiated
            transactions,  at  prices  not in  excess  of the fair  market
            value of the  Company  Stock on the  date of  purchase.  Sales
            of  shares  will  also  be  made  in  the  open  market  or in
            privately  negotiated  transactions  at prices  not lower than
            the fair  market  value of Company  Stock on the date of sale.
            The  Trustee,  or its  designated  agent,  may limit the daily
            volume of  purchases  and sales to the extent it  believes  it
            will be in the interest of Participants to do so.
                        (5)  The Brokerage Option:
                              (i)  Description of Funds:  This  investment
                  option  will be  administered  by State  Street Bank and
                  the agents it employs as  securities  brokers to execute
                  Participants'   trades.   This  option  permits  certain
                  Participants  and  Beneficiaries  to  invest  all  or  a
                  portion  of their  interest  in the  Plan in  additional
                  choices   for   self-directed   investment.   The   Plan
                  Administrator    shall   publish   written   rules   and
                  procedures   for  the   election  of  
                                       V-5
<PAGE>
 
          these additional  choices by Participants and  Beneficiaries,  and may
          revise such rules and  procedures at any time and for any reason.  The
          investments  expected to be available  under the Brokerage  Option are
          generally  as  follows:  securities  traded  on  the  New  York  Stock
          Exchange,  the American Stock Exchange,  and the NASDAQ exchange,  and
          certain mutual funds as specified by the Plan Administrator.
                                    (A)  The  following  investments  will
                        not be  available  through the  Brokerage  Option:
                        Non-taxable     bonds;      options;      futures;
                        commodities;   limited   partnerships   which  are
                        unlisted  on  the  New  York  or  American   Stock
                        Exchange   or   the   NASDAQ   exchange;   foreign
                        securities  which are  unlisted on the New York or
                        American  Stock  Exchange or the NASDAQ  exchange;
                        commercial   paper;   bank  investments  (such  as
                        certificates   of  deposits  and  bank  investment
                        contracts);  physical assets (such as coins,  art,
                        jewelry,  and real estate);  insurance  investment
                        or insurance  investment  funds;  mutual funds not
                        specified   by   the   Plan   Administrator;   and
                        securities  of the  Company  or  its  subsidiaries
                        (even  if  listed  on the  New  York  or  American
                        Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ exchange).
                                    (B) The  following  trading  practices
                        are prohibited under the Brokerage  Option:  Short
                        sales, margin trades,  third party trades,  direct
                        trades,  and  any  trades  occurring  outside  the
                        procedures established by the Plan Administrator.
                              (ii)  Restrictions:   Each  Participant  who
                  participates  in the  Brokerage  Option  shall  have his
                  interest   in  the  Plan   reduced   by  any   brokerage
                  commissions   and  fees   (including   fees  charged  on
                  account  of one or more  investments  in a mutual  fund)
                  payable  on  their  individual  transactions  and  shall
                  also  have  his  interest  in  the  Plan  reduced  by an
                  access  fee  (initially  $4.20)  for each  month or part
                  thereof  that  the   Participant   participates  in  the
                  Brokerage  Option.  Such  access  fee will be taken from
                                       V-6

                  the Plan in the  following  order:  Security  Plus Fund,
                  Equity-Index  Fund, Equity Income Fund,  PepsiCo Capital
                  Stock   Fund  and  the   Brokerage   Option.   The  Plan
                  Administrator,  and its agent,  are  authorized  to sell
                  securities  or other assets held within a  Participant's
                  Account  for the purpose of paying the  commissions  and
                  fees  described in this  subsection.  Investment  in the
                  Brokerage   Option   is   subject   to   the   following
                  restrictions:
                                    (A)  To   commence   investing   under
                        this  program,   the  Participant  must  first  be
                        eligible  to enroll  in the  Brokerage  Option.  A
                        Participant  is  eligible  to  enroll if he has at
                        least  $1,000.00  in  his   Participant   Account;
                        completes   and   returns   the   application   as
                        required by the Plan  Administrator  or its agent;
                        and  his  initial   transfer   election  into  the
                        Brokerage  Option is at least  $1,000.  Subsequent
                        transfers  to and from the  Brokerage  Option must
                        be  at  least  $250  unless  such  transfer  is to
                        close   the   Participant's   account   under  the
                        Brokerage    Option.    All   transfers   to   the
                        Brokerage Option must be from prior savings.
                                    (B)  No  amounts  invested  either  in
                        the  Security  Plus  Fund  or  in  the  Guaranteed
                        Income  Fund may be  directly  transferred  to the
                        Brokerage  Option,  and no amounts invested either
                        in the  Security  Plus  Fund or in the  Guaranteed
                        Income Fund may be indirectly  transferred  to the
                        Brokerage  Option,  i.e.,  by  first  transferring
                        the  amounts  to some  other  investment  fund (or
                        funds)   under  the  Plan,   unless  such  amounts
                        remain  invested  in  the  intervening   fund  (or
                        funds) for at least 3 months.
                                    (C)  Except  as  provided  in the last
                        sentence  of  this  clause  (C),  no  security  or
                        investment   held  by  a   Participant's   account
                        within the  Brokerage  Option  may be  transferred
                        or distributed  directly to the  Participant.  The
                        Participant  must  initially  sell the security or
                        investment.  The Trustee  will place the  proceeds
                        of such  
                                       V-7

                        sale  in a  short-term  investment  fund,
                        designed  to  generate  a  money  market  rate  of
                        return,   within   the   Brokerage   Option.   The
                        proceeds  will  remain in such  account  until the
                        Participant  instructs the Plan  Administrator  or
                        its agent to  transfer  all or a  portion  of such
                        proceeds  into one or more of the  other  separate
                        investment   options   within   the   Trust   Fund
                        provided  that the  investment  option  chosen  by
                        the   Participant   permits   contributions.   The
                        crediting  of  earnings   within  the   short-term
                        investment  fund  and the  transfer  of  funds  to
                        other  investment  funds within the Trust Fund may
                        be delayed until after the  settlement  period for
                        the  class of  security  sold by the  Participant,
                        ranging from one to five  business  days.  In-kind
                        distributions  are  permitted  in the  event  of a
                        complete    distribution    of   a   Participant's
                        interest as specified under Section 6.1 or 6.2.
                        (6)  The  Guaranteed  Income  Fund:  This  fund is
            established  through  contractual  arrangements  with  one  or
            more  insurance  companies  or other  financial  institutions.
            Effective  January  1, 1992,  the  Guaranteed  Income  Fund no
            longer  accepts  additional  deposits.  As of January 1, 1992,
            two 1991  Guaranteed  Income  Fund  contracts,  both issued by
            Metropolitan  Life,  were  transferred  to the  Security  Plus
            Fund.  The  return on  amounts  that  remain  invested  in the
            Guaranteed  Income Fund is determined  in accordance  with the
            contract (or  contracts)  applicable  to the year in which the
            amounts were  invested.  Guarantees  of principal and interest
            are  provided  solely  by  the  insurance   company  or  other
            financial  institution  issuing the contract.  The transfer of
            funds  invested  in  the  Guaranteed   Income  Fund  to  other
            separate  investment  funds  within  the  Trust  Fund  will be
            restricted in the following manner:
                              (i) No amounts  invested  in the  Guaranteed
                  Income  Fund for any Plan Year may be  transferred  by a
                  Participant  directly  into the  Security  Plus  Fund or
                  the  Brokerage   Option.  No  amounts  invested  in  the
                  Guaranteed   Income  Fund  for  any  Plan  Year  may  be
                  transferred   by  a   Participant   
                                       V-8
<PAGE>

               indirectly  to the Security Plus Fund or the  Brokerage Option,
               i.e., by first  transferring the amounts to some other invest-
               ment fund (or funds) under the Plan, unless such amounts remain
               invested in the intervening fund (or funds)for at least 3 months;
               and (ii) A  Participant  can  transfer  amounts from the
               Guaranteed Income Fund into some other
               investment  fund (or funds)  under the Plan no more than
               12 times during the Plan Year.
                  (b)     Maintaining      Liquidity:      Notwithstanding
      subsection  (a) above,  for the purpose of  providing  liquidity  in
      each of the separate  investment  options  (other than the Brokerage
      Option)  under the Plan,  the  Trustee  may invest a portion of each
      fund or  investment  option  under  the  Plan in cash or  short-term
      securities.  The  percentage  of  assets  held for this  purpose  is
      normally   expected   to  range   from  2-10   percent,   but  under
      extraordinary  circumstances  the percentages  may be  substantially
      higher.  Consequently,   the  mix  of  cash,  securities  and  other
      investments   in   each  of  the   investment   funds   could   vary
      significantly   at  any  given  time  and  the  performance  of  any
      particular  fund  may  not  match  the  performance  of the  fund or
      stock,  as the  case  may be,  outside  the  Plan.  In the  unlikely
      event  that the  amount  of  liquid  assets  held by these  funds is
      insufficient  to satisfy the immediate  demand for  liquidity  under
      the   Plan,   the   Trustee,   in   consultation   with   the   Plan
      Administrator,  may  temporarily  limit or suspend  transfers of any
      type  (including  withdrawals  and  distributions)  to or  from  the
      investment  options  specified in subsection  (a). In any such case,
      the  Plan   Administrator   shall  temporarily   change  the  Plan's
      Valuation  Date or,  in its  discretion,  the  Valuation  Date for a
      specific   option.   During  this  period,   contributions   to  any
      affected option may be redirected to substitute  investments  chosen
      by the Trustee.
                  (c)   Procedures   for    Investment    Directions:    A
      Participant  may direct the  investment  of the amounts  credited to
      him  under  the  Plan  into  the  investment  options  described  in
      subsection  (a)  only  in  accordance   with  this   subsection.   A
      Participant  shall direct the  investment,  or change the  direction
      of  the  investment,   of  his  future  or  existing  investment  by
      directing the Plan  Administrator  through the telephone  enrollment
      system  

                                       V-9
<PAGE>

      provided  by the Plan  Administrator  for such  purpose  (or
      through any other method made  available by the Plan  Administrator)
      and   by   specifying    whether   the   Participant's    investment
      instructions  apply to existing  savings,  future  contributions  or
      both.
                        (1)    The    Participant     will    have    sole
            responsibility  for  the  investment  of his  savings  and for
            transfers among the available  investment  funds, and no named
            fiduciary  or other  person  will have any  liability  for any
            loss or diminution in value  resulting from the  Participant's
            exercise  of  such  investment  responsibility.  In  addition,
            because  Participants  control the  investment of  Participant
            Accounts,  the Plan is  intended  to be covered to the maximum
            extent  possible  by  section  404(c)  of  ERISA  and  related
            Department  of Labor  regulations,  which  provide  that  Plan
            fiduciaries  may be relieved of liability  for any losses that
            are  the  result  of  investment   instructions   given  by  a
            Participant or Beneficiary.
                        (2)  In the  case  of an  option  other  than  the
            Brokerage  Option, a Participant's  investment  instruction or
            change in investment  instruction  shall take effect as of the
            end  of  the  day  on  which  the   Participant   gives   such
            instruction  or  change  to the  Plan  Administrator  (or  its
            agent),  provided the  Participant  executes such  instruction
            or change by 3:00 p.m.  (Eastern  time) on a business  day. If
            the  Participant  executes  his  instruction  or  change  on a
            Saturday,  Sunday,  holiday or after 3:00 p.m.  (Eastern time)
            on a business  day,  such  instruction  or change  will become
            effective on the next following business day.
                        (3)  In  the  case  of  the  Brokerage  Option,  a
            Participant's  investment  instruction  or change  within  the
            Brokerage  Option or fund transfers into the Brokerage  Option
            shall be effective in  accordance  with rules set forth by the
            Plan  Administrator  consistent with the rules that govern the
            exchange or fund in which Participants invest.
      Any investment  direction  submitted by a Participant  must specify,
      in whole  percentages  (1 to 100), the percentage of his accounts to
      be  invested  in  any  or  all  of  the  separate  investment  funds
      maintained  under  the  Plan.  If a  Participant  fails to  submit a
      statement of direction  properly  directing  the  investment  of 100
      percent of his  accounts,  and such  failure 
                                       V-10
<PAGE>

          is not corrected, the Participant shall not be eligible to participate
          actively,  or to  continue  to  participate  actively,  in  the  Plan;
          provided,  however,  that amounts  previously  invested  pursuant to a
          properly executed statement of investment  direction shall continue to
          remain  invested  in the Fund or  Funds  so  elected.  The  rules  for
          transfers set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3) above are subject to the
          last 3 sentences of subsection (b) above.
                  (d)  Miscellaneous:
                        (1) It is  expressly  permissible  under this Plan
            for Trust assets
            to be  invested in  qualifying  employer  securities,  as that
            term is  defined  in  section  407(d)(5)  of ERISA,  up to and
            including  100 percent of the total Trust  assets.  If Company
            Stock  is  purchased  other  than  on  the  open  market,  the
            Company  Stock  shall be valued in good faith and based on all
            relevant  factors,  including  the sales prices of such stock,
            as  reported  on the New York Stock  Exchange,  on the date of
            purchase.
                        (2)   The   separate    investment    funds   made
            available  under the Trust Fund and their  rules of  operation
            and  valuation  may be changed  from time to time by agreement
            between the Company and the Trustee.
                        (3) As of each  Valuation  Date,  the Trustee will
            determine  the  fair  market  value  of  the  assets  in  each
            separate  investment  fund of the  Trust  Fund,  relying  upon
            such evidence of valuation as the Trustee deems appropriate.
            5.3   Adjusting   Account   Balances:   As  of  the  close  of
business on each  Valuation  Date  (before  adjusting  for  contributions,
distributions and investment  transfers),  Participants' Accounts shall be
charged or credited with:
                  (a)  Investment Expenses,
                  (b)  Investment income, and
                  (c)  Gains and losses in asset values,
to the extent they have  occurred  with  respect to each  separate  option
(and each  separate  investment  within the  Brokerage  Option)  since the
preceding  Valuation Date.  Thereafter,  the final Account  balances as of
the   Valuation   Date  will  be   determined  by  adjusting  the  amounts
determined under the preceding sentence for  contributions,  distributions
and  investment  transfers.  The  allocation  of  
                                       V-11
<PAGE>

                                       

Investment  Expenses and  investment  results as of a Valuation Date shall be in
proportion  to the final  Account  balances in the fund or  investment as of the
preceding  Valuation  Date.  Gains and losses in assets values as of a Valuation
Date shall be determined in accordance with rules of the Plan  Administrator and
may not reflect the closing values of the assets on such Valuation Date.

                      Distributions To Participants

            6.1  Termination  of  Employment:  Subject to  Section  6.2, a
Participant  who incurs a Termination  of Employment  under the Plan shall
be  entitled  to receive  the entire  amount of his  interest  in the Plan
computed  as of: (i) the  Valuation  Date on which the final  distribution
form for the  Participant  is  processed by the  Recordkeeper,  or (ii) if
the  Participant's  interest in the Plan is $3,500 or less,  the Valuation
Date  on  which  the  Recordkeeper   processes  the  distribution  of  the
Participant's  Account  (such  distribution  to be  processed  as  soon as
practicable  after the 90 days  specified in section  6.6(d)).  Subject to
Section 6.6(a),  the  Participant's  interest at Termination of Employment
shall be payable to the  Participant  as a lump sum  distribution  as soon
as practicable.
            6.2  Death:  Subject to  Section  7.1(b),  in the event of the
death of a  Participant,  the entire  amount,  if any, of the  interest of
such  Participant  in the Plan shall be paid as provided  in Section  6.1,
except  that it shall be  payable  to such  Participant's  Beneficiary  or
Beneficiaries determined in accordance with Article VIII.
            6.3   Withdrawals:   Subject  to  the  restriction  on  direct
withdrawals  from the Brokerage  Option specified in Subsection (c) below,
a Participant  who has made a Salary  Deferral  Contribution or a Rollover
Contribution   may  withdraw   certain  amounts  credited  to  his  Salary
Deferral  Account and  Rollover  Account to the extent  permitted  by this
section.
                  (a)   Hardship   Withdrawals:   In   the   case   of   a
      Participant   who  has  not  yet   attained   the  age  of   59-1/2,
      withdrawals   shall   only   be   permitted   on   account   of  the
      Participant's  hardship.  For this purpose,  a withdrawal is made on
      account  of  hardship  only  if  the  Plan   Administrator  (or  its
      delegate)  determines  the  withdrawal is: (A) made on account of an
      immediate  and  heavy  financial  need of the  Participant,  and (B)
      necessary to satisfy this financial  need. Such  determinations  are
      intended to follow  applicable  regulations  and  rulings  issued by
      the Internal Revenue Service.
                                       VI-1
<PAGE>

                        (1)  Immediate  and  Heavy   Financial  Need:  The
            determination  of whether a  Participant  has an immediate and
            heavy  financial  need  shall be based on all of the  relevant
            facts and  circumstances.  In addition,  a distribution  shall
            be  deemed to be made on  account  of an  immediate  and heavy
            financial need of the  Participant if the  distribution  is on
            account of:

                              (i)  Expenses  for medical  care (within the
                  meaning  of  Code  section   213(d))   incurred  by  the
                  Employee, the Employee's spouse or dependents;
                              (ii)  A  cost   directly   related   to  the
                  purchase  (excluding  mortgage  payments) of a principal
                  residence for the Employee;
                              (iii)   Payment  of  tuition   and   related
                  educational   fees   for   the   next   12   months   of
                  post-secondary   education   for   the   Employee,   the
                  Employee's spouse, children or dependents; or
                              (iv) The need to  prevent  the  eviction  of
                  the  Employee  from,  or a  foreclosure  on the mortgage
                  of, the Employee's principal residence.
                        For  purposes  of  this   paragraph,   "dependent"
            means an  Employee's  dependent  within  the  meaning  of Code
            section 152.
          (2) Necessary for the Need: A withdrawal shall be considered necessary
          to satisfy a need  described in paragraph (1) only to the extent:  (A)
          the amount of the  withdrawal is not in excess of the amount  required
          to relieve such need,  and (B) the need cannot be satisfied from other
          resources   that  are   reasonably   available  to  the   Participant.
          Determinations  under  this  paragraph  shall  be  based on all of the
          relevant  facts and  circumstances.  A  distribution  generally may be
          treated  as  necessary  to  satisfy  a  financial  need  if  the  Plan
          Administrator (or its delegate) relies upon the Participant's written
                                       VI-3
<PAGE>


          representation  (unless the Plan Administrator has actual knowledge to
          the contrary) that the need cannot reasonably be relieved:
                              (i) Through  reimbursement  or  compensation
                  by insurance or otherwise;
                              (ii)  By  liquidation  of the  Participant's
                  assets;
                              (iii)  By  cessation   of  Salary   Deferral
                  Contributions;
                              (iv) By other  distributions  or  nontaxable
                  loans  from  plans  maintained  by  an  employer,  or by
                  borrowing   from   commercial   sources  on   reasonable
                  commercial  terms,  in an amount  sufficient  to satisfy
                  the need.
                  For  this   purpose,   a  need   cannot  be  treated  as
      reasonably  relieved  from the  sources  listed  above if the effect
      would be to increase the amount of the need.
                        (3)  Maximum  Withdrawal:  The amount  that may be
            made  available to a Participant  for hardship  withdrawal may
            not exceed:
                              (i)  The sum of:
                              (A)   the    Participant's    total   Salary
                  Deferral Contributions,
                              (B)  any   earnings  on  the   Participant's
                  Salary   Deferral    Contributions   credited   to   the
                  Participant's Account on December 31. 1988, and
                              (C)   the   Participant's   total   Rollover
                  Contributions   (and  contributions  on  behalf  of  the
                  Participant  to any other  accounts that may be provided
                  for  in  the  Appendix)   plus  any  earnings   thereon;
                  reduced by
                              (ii) The  amount  of any  prior  withdrawals
                  and distributions to or on behalf of the Participant.

                                       VI-3
<PAGE>

      The amounts specified in this paragraph (except that specified in
      subparagraph  (i)(B)) are to be determined  as of the Valuation  Date
      on which the withdrawal is processed.
                        (4)   Administrative   Procedures:   A   withdrawal
            request  under  this  subsection  shall  be  made  on the  form
            specified  for this  purpose by the Plan  Administrator.  For a
            withdrawal  to be approved,  this form must be fully  completed
            and the Participant  must provide such  additional  information
            as the Plan  Administrator  (or its  delegate)  shall  request.
            The hardship  withdrawal  shall be paid to the  Participant  as
            promptly  as  practicable  after  its  approval  and  shall not
            exceed the value of the Participant's distributable interest.
                  (b)  Post-Age  59-1/2  Withdrawals:  In  the  case  of  a
      Participant who has attained age 59-1/2,  such  Participant  shall be
      eligible to withdraw  amounts from his Account by  submitting  to the
      Plan  Administrator  a request  in such  form and  manner as the Plan
      Administrator  may provide,  specifying  the amount to be  withdrawn;
      provided,  however,  that a Participant shall be ineligible to make a
      withdrawal  under this  subsection  more than 2 times within the same
      calendar  year.  Distribution  shall  be made to the  Participant  as
      soon as practicable  after the withdrawal  request is received by the
      Plan  Administrator,  based  upon the  Participant's  balance  in his
      Account as of the Valuation Date the withdrawal is processed.
                  (c)  Order  of  Asset  Liquidation  for all  Withdrawals:
      In the event the  Participant's  Account is invested in more than one
      investment   option,   a  partial   withdrawal  will  be  distributed
      pro-rata from each of the investment  options from which  withdrawals
      are  available  subject  to  the  following   requirements:   amounts
      invested in the Security Plus Fund must be withdrawn  before  amounts
      invested  in  the  Guaranteed  Income  Fund  can  be  withdrawn,  and
      amounts  invested in the  Guaranteed  Income Fund shall be  withdrawn
      in reverse order of the  Participant's  investment in the
                                       VI-4
<PAGE>

          underlying  contracts,   i.e.,  the  most  recent  contract  shall  be
          liquidated first. In addition, withdrawals directly from the Brokerage
          Account are not permitted.
            6.4  Form of  Distributions:  Distributions  under  the Plan on
account  of  Termination  of  Employment  or  death  shall be made in cash,
except  to the  extent  that a  Participant  elects  to  receive:  (i)  his
interest  in the  PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  Fund in whole  shares of Company
Stock;  or (ii)  securities  held in his  Brokerage  Option as permitted in
Section  5.2(a)(5)(ii)(C).  An election to receive an in-kind  distribution
shall not apply to fractional  shares,  uninvested cash or amounts invested
for  liquidity  purposes,  and  shall  not be  available  with  respect  to
hardship withdrawals under section 6.3(a).
            6.5  Errors  in  Participant's   Accounts:  When  an  error  or
omission  is  discovered  in  an  account  of  a   Participant,   the  Plan
Administrator  and the Trustee shall be  authorized to make such  equitable
adjustments  as may be  appropriate  as of the Plan Year in which the error
or omission is discovered.
            6.6  Commencement  of  Payments:  Notwithstanding  anything  in
the Plan to the contrary,  the  distribution  of a  Participant's  benefits
hereunder  shall be determined in  accordance  with the  provisions of this
section and shall  otherwise  comply with Code  section  401(a)(9)  and the
regulations under section 401(a)(9)  including  section  1.401(a)(9)-2.  In
addition,  any  provisions of the Plan that reflect Code section  401(a)(9)
(including  subsection (b) below) override any other  distribution  options
in the Plan that are inconsistent with Code section 401(a)(9).
                  (a)  Consent  Requirements:  Effective  as of  January 1,
      1985, if the      value  of a  Participant's  total  interest  in the
      Plan exceeds  $3,500 at the time a distribution  is to be made,  then
      such  interest  shall  not  be  distributed  hereunder  prior  to the
      Participant's  attainment  of age 65 or death unless the  Participant
      consents   in   writing,   on  a  form   prescribed   by   the   Plan
      Administrator,  to the earlier  distribution  of his  interest in the
      Plan.  However,  upon  termination  of the  Plan,  the  Participant's
      interest may, without the  Participant's  consent,  be distributed to
      him or transferred to
                                       VI-5
<PAGE>

          another  defined  contribution  plan  (other  than an  employee  stock
          ownership  plan as defined in Code section  4975(e)(7))  maintained by
          the Employer.
                  (b)  Code  Section  401(a)(14)  Provisions:   Subject  to
      subsection (c) below,  distribution  of a  Participant's  interest in
      the Plan shall not  commence  later than the 60th day after the close
      of the latest of the following:
                        (1)  The  Plan  Year  in  which   the   Participant
            attains age 65,
                        (2)  The  Plan  Year  in  which  occurs  the  tenth
            anniversary of the date his participation commenced,
                        (3)   The   Plan   Year   in   which   occurs   the
            Participant's Termination of Employment, or
                        (4) The  Plan  Year  containing  the  date to which
            the  Participant  has elected in writing to defer  commencement
            of his Plan distribution.
            If a  distribution  otherwise  payable to a Participant  or his
            Beneficiary   hereunder   remains   unpaid   because  the  Plan
            Administrator  (after making reasonable  efforts) cannot locate
            the  Participant or  Beneficiary,  the amount so  distributable
            shall be  treated  as a  forfeiture  under the Plan.  Following
            its  forfeiture,  such amount  shall be used to pay any expense
            of Plan  administration  which  may be  charged  to the Plan in
            accordance  with  ERISA.  In the event the  Participant  or his
            Beneficiary  is located  subsequent  to the  forfeiture  of his
            Account,  such Account  shall be restored,  without  adjustment
            for  earnings  or losses,  and  payment to the  Participant  or
            Beneficiary  shall  be made no  later  than 60 days  after  the
            date on which the Plan  Administrator  locates the  Participant
            or Beneficiary.
                  (c)  Code Section 401(a)(9) Provisions:
                        (1) A  Participant's  total  interest  in the  Plan
            must be  distributed  to him no later  than  the  Participant's
            required beginning date.

<PAGE>

           
                              (i)  In  the  case  of a  Participant  who is
                  not  a  percent   owner   after   1979,   the   "required
                  beginning date" shall be determined as follows:
                                    (A)  If  the  Participant  attains  age
                        70-1/2 after 1987,  the required  beginning date is
                        the April 1 following  the  calendar  year in which
                        the   Participant   attains  age  70-1/2  (but  not
                        before April 1, 1990).
                                    (B)  If  the  Participant  attains  age
                        70-1/2  before 1988,  the required  beginning  date
                        is the  April  1  following  the  calendar  year in
                        which  occurs  the  later  of  his  Termination  of
                        Employment or attainment of age 70-1/2.
                              (ii) In the  case of a  Participant  who is a
                  5 percent owner after 1979,  the required  beginning date
                  is the April 1 following the later of:
                                    (A)  the  calendar  year in  which  the
                        Participant attains age 70-1/2, or
                                    (B) the  first  calendar  year in which
                        the  Participant  either  becomes a 5 percent owner
                        or terminates employment.
                              For purposes of this  paragraph,  a 5-percent
                  owner  is any  Participant  who is a  5-percent  owner as
                  defined  in  section  416(i) of the Code  (determined  in
                  accordance   with  section  416  but  without  regard  to
                  whether  the Plan is  top-heavy)  at any time  during the
                  Plan Year  ending  with or within  the  calendar  year in
                  which such  owner  attains  age 66-1/2 or any  subsequent
                  Plan Year.
                        (2) In the  event  a  Participant  dies  on or  after
            his  Annuity   Starting  Date  but  before  actual   payment  has
            commenced,  the  Participant's  total  interest  in the  Plan (if
            any) shall be  distributed  by December 31 of the  calendar  year
            containing  the  fifth  anniversary  of  the  Participant's  date
            of
                                       VI-7
<PAGE>


            death occurs.  Notwithstanding the preceding  sentence,  if the
            Participant's  designated  beneficiary  is his  surviving  spouse
            and the surviving spouse dies after the  Participant,  but before
            payments  to  such  spouse   begin,   the   provisions   of  this
            subsection  6.6(c)(2)  shall  be  applied  as  if  the  surviving
            spouse were the Participant.
                  (d)  Cashout  Distributions:  Subject to the last  sentence
      of this  subsection,  upon a Participant's  death or other  Termination
      of  Employment,  the value of the  Participant's  total interest in the
      Plan  shall be  automatically  distributed  to him in a  lump-sum  cash
      distribution  as soon as  practicable  following the earlier of (i) the
      date the  Participant  reaches age 65 (or such later date as  permitted
      by  the  Plan   Administrator   in   accordance   with   Code   section
      401(a)(14));  or (ii) 90 days after the  Participant's  Termination  of
      Employment.  However,  such a  Participant  (or where  the  Participant
      has  died,  his  Beneficiary  as  determined  under  Article  VIII) can
      effect an earlier  distribution  by  submitting  a  properly  completed
      final   distribution   form  in  the  manner   specified  by  the  Plan
      Administrator.  By submitting a properly  completed final  distribution
      form, the Participant  may elect to receive an in-kind  distribution as
      provided  in  Section  6.4.   Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  this
      Section  6.6(d)  to the  contrary,  if  such  Participant  is  disabled
      (within the meaning of the PepsiCo  Long Term  Disability  Plan) or has
      a total  interest  in the Plan in excess of $3,500 and has not died,  a
      distribution  of his total  interest  in the Plan will not occur  until
      the  earlier of: (i) the date the  Participant  attains age 65 (or such
      later date as permitted by the Plan  Administrator  in accordance  with
      Code section  401(a)(14));  or (ii) the date the Participant  submits a
      properly  completed final  distribution form in the manner specified by
      the Plan Administrator.
            6.7  Payment  for  Benefit  of  Disabled  or   Incapacitated   
Person:  Whenever,  in the opinion of the Plan  Administrator or its agent,
a person  entitled to receive any payment of a benefit  hereunder  is under
a legal  disability  or is  incapacitated  in any way so as to be unable 
                                       VI-8
<PAGE>

to manage  his  financial  affairs,  the Plan  Administrator  or its agent may
direct  the  Trustee  to make  payments  to  such  person  or to his  legal
representative  or to a relative or friend of such person for his  benefit,
or the Plan  Administrator  or its agent may  direct  the  Trustee to apply
the  payment  for the  benefit  of such  person in such  manner as the Plan
Administrator  or its agent considers  advisable.  Any payment of a benefit
or  installment  thereof in accordance  with the provisions of this section
shall be a  complete  discharge  of any  liability  for the  making of such
payment under the provisions of the Plan.
            6.8 No Other  Benefits  or  Withdrawals:  Except  as  expressly
provided for in this Article VI or the Appendix,  no individual,  whether a
Participant,  former  Participant,   Beneficiary  or  otherwise,  shall  be
entitled to any distribution or withdrawal of funds from the Trust Fund.
            6.9   Participants   Who  Cannot  Be   Located:   If  the  Plan
Administrator  after the  passage of a period of time (which  period  shall
be  established by the Plan  Administrator  in accordance  with  reasonable
administrative  practices)  and  reasonable  due  diligence  is  unable  to
locate an  inactive  Participant  or  Beneficiary  to whom a payment is due
under this  Article VI, the amount of the Account due such person  shall be
treated  as a  forfeiture  hereunder,  provided  that  any  such  forfeited
benefits shall be subject to reinstatement  if the inactive  Participant or
Beneficiary  ever makes a valid claim for the  benefit.  If a claim is made
for a benefit  that was  forfeited  under this  Section 6.9, the benefit to
be restored  shall be the dollar value of the Account  that was  forfeited,
determined  as of the date the  forfeiture  occurred  without any interest,
earnings or  adjustments in value  occurring  after the date of forfeiture.
This  Section  6.9  shall  be  administered  by the Plan  Administrator  in
accordance with any  restrictions  mandated by law.  Forfeitures  occurring
pursuant  to  this  Section  6.9  shall  be used to pay  Plan  expenses  as
described  in Section 9.2 and,  to the extent not so used or  reserved  for
such use, shall be allocated to  Participants  in the manner  determined by
Plan amendment.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                                  Plan Loans

            7.1  Eligibility  for Plan loans:  Subject to the  restrictions
set forth in this  Article VII,  the  opportunity to take a Plan loan shall
be made  available to any  Participant  who, at the time such loan is to be
made:
                  (a) is actively  employed  by an Employer  who has agreed
      to participate in the loan program;
                  (b)  has a  minimum  account  balance  of  $2,000  in the
      Plan;
                  (c) has not  defaulted  on a Plan loan  within  the prior
      two years; and
                  (d)  consents  to and  authorizes  repayment  of the loan
      through payroll deductions.
Employers  that  are  not   participating   in  the  loan  program  may  be
designated by the Plan  Administrator  from time to time.  The  requirement
of  subsection  (a)  above  shall  be  deemed  satisfied  in the  case of a
Participant  who is not currently  employed if the  Participant  is a party
in interest  within the meaning of ERISA  section  3(14).  For  purposes of
subsection  (c)  above,  the  time of  default  shall be  determined  under
Section 7.9
            7.2  Application  Procedure:  A  Participant  shall apply for a
loan  by  calling  into  the  telephone  system  established  by  the  Plan
Administrator   and  providing  the   requested   information   ("Telephone
Application").  As soon as practicable  after the  Participant's  Telephone
Application,   the  Plan  Administrator   shall  send  such  Participant  a
promissory note, an  authorization  form for withholding loan payments from
the  Participant's  pay, a document  granting the Plan a security  interest
in the  Participant's  Plan  account,  and any  other  documents  the  Plan
Administrator  deems  appropriate  ("Application  Forms").  The  promissory
note shall state the amount and term of the loan, the  applicable  interest
rate and repayment  

                                       VII-1
<PAGE>


     schedule, and other information as determined by the Plan Administrator. To
complete the  application,  the  Participant  must  properly  fill out, sign and
return the Application Forms so that they are received by the Plan Administrator
within 30 days of the date of the  Application  Forms are  prepared by the Plan.
The Plan  Administrator  shall approve a Participant's  loan  application if the
Participant:
                  (a)  is eligible for a loan pursuant to Article 7.1,
                  (b)  has  properly  completed  and  timely  returned  the
      Application Forms, and
                  (c) is  requesting  a loan  that  meets the terms of this
      Article VII and the summary plan description for this Plan.
An approved  loan will be disbursed as soon as  practicable  after the Plan
Administrator has received the Application Forms from the Participant.
            7.3 Loan  Amount:  A Plan loan  shall  not be less than  $1,000
nor, when  aggregated  with all other  outstanding  loans to such borrowing
Participant  from  qualified  retirement  plans  of  the  Company  and  any
affiliated  companies,  exceed the least of  (rounded  down to the  nearest
hundred):
                  (a)   $50,000   (reduced   by  the   excess  of  (i)  the
      Participant's  highest  outstanding loan balance during the preceding
      one-year  period  ending  on the day  before  the  date  the loan was
      made,  over (ii) the  outstanding  balance  of loans from the Plan on
      the date the loan is made);
                  (b) 50% of the  Participant's  account  balance under the
      Plan;
                  (c) 100% of the  value of the  Participant's  investments
      in the  following  "Core"  Funds:  PepsiCo  Capital  Stock,  Security
      Plus, Equity-Index and Equity Income; or
                  (d) the  maximum  loan amount  that can be  amortized  by
      the Participant's net pay (determined under Section 7.8).
                                       VII-2
<PAGE>

The value of the  Participant's  account balance and investment in the Core
Funds  shall be based on the  market  values  of such  items at the time of
the  participant's  Telephone  Applications  or the  issuance  of the loan,
whichever is less.
            7.4      Maximum Number of Outstanding Loans and Refinancing:
                  (a)    A  Participant  shall  not have more than one loan
outstanding  from the Plan at any  time.  Subject  to  subsection  (b),  no
loan may be made to a  Participant  until  the  repayment  of any  previous
loan to such Participant.
                  (b)    A Participant  with an  outstanding  loan from the
Plan is eligible to apply for a refinanced  loan,  provided the  refinanced
loan is  issued  at  least  two  year  (six  months,  effective  as soon as
practicable  after  October  20,  1995) after  issuance of the  outstanding
loan.  A  refinanced  loan shall meet all the  requirements  for a loan set
forth in this Article  VII.  Its  proceeds  shall first be applied to repay
the balance of the  outstanding  loan,  with any  remainder  payable to the
Participant  as  cash.  The  interest  rate,   fees,   term  and  repayment
schedule  applicable  to a  refinanced  loan  shall be  determined  without
reference to the original loan.
            7.5      Effect  on  Participant's  Investment:  A  loan  shall
constitute a segregated  investment  solely of the Account of the borrowing
Participant.
                  (a)    When  initially  made, a loan shall be funded from
the borrowing  Participant's  Core Fund investments,  prorated based on the
Participant's balance in each Core Fund.
                  (b)    All  repayments of principal and related  interest
any  gains  and  losses  on a loan  shall  be  credited  to  the  borrowing
Participant's  account.  Loan  repayments  shall be invested in  accordance
with the  Participant's  current  investment  direction for Salary Deferral
Contributions.   If  the  Participant   does  not  have  an  investment  in
direction  in effect  on the date of the  Participant's  Loan  Application,
the Participant must provide an investment

                                       VII-3

<PAGE>

      direction  as  part  of  his  loan   application.   When  a  selected
      investment  is no  longer  available,  or when  otherwise  necessary,
      loan  repayments  shall be  invested in the manner  specified  by the
      Plan Administrator from time to time.
                  (c) A loan  shall be  adequately  secured  at all  times.
      All loans are secured by the portion of the  borrowing  Participant's
      Account  that  is  invested  in  the   Participant's   loan.  If  the
      principal  amount of a loan  immediately  after its issuance does not
      exceed 50 percent of the  Participant's  Account as of such time, the
      loan shall be deemed adequately secured at all times hereunder.
            7.6 Fees.  Following  the  issuance  of a loan,  the  borrowing
Participant  shall pay a one-time  origination  fee. For each month or part
thereof the loan remains  outstanding the borrowing  Participant  shall pay
a  monthly  administration  fee.  Such  fee  shall  be  deducted  from  the
Participant's  Account at the end of the  applicable  month.  They shall be
charged  against the  position of the Account  that is not  invested in the
loan,  in  accordance  with rules  adopted by the Plan  Administrator.  The
fees  applicable  to a  Participant's  loan shall be determined on the date
of the  Participant's  Telephone  Application  and shall not  change  while
such loan is outstanding.
            7.7  Interest  Rate.  Plan loans shall bear a  reasonable  rate
of interest  that  provides  the Plan with a return  commensurate  with the
interest  rates  charged by persons in the  business  of lending  money for
loans  which  would  be  made  under  similar  circumstances  as  part of a
similar  nationwide  loan  program.  To this  end,  the Plan  Administrator
shall adopt rules and procedures for  redetermining  on a monthly basis the
interest  rate  applicable  to new Plan loans.  The  interest  rate for any
loan shall be fixed for the period of the loan and shall be  determined  as
of the date of the related  Telephone  Application.  No interest rate shall
be less than the  applicable  federal rate in effect under Section  1274(d)
of the  Code,  as of the day on which  the loan was  initiated,  compounded
annually.

            7.8  Term and Repayment.

                  (a) Term.  Subject to  subsections  (c) through  (e), the
      term of a loan  shall be not  less  than 1 year  nor  greater  than 4
      years, measuring from the date of issuance.
                  (b)  Repayment.   Subject  to  subsections   (c)  through
      (e), a  borrowing  Participant  shall repay his  outstanding  loan by
      making  substantially  level  amortization  payments at the  interval
      determined  by  the  Plan   Administrator.   When  a  Participant  is
      receiving  net pay,  this shall be the interval of the  Participant's
      regular  payroll checks from the Employer,  and loan  repayments (and
      any  outstanding  loan  amounts  that are due and  payable)  shall be
      withheld  from  the  Participant's  net pay to the  extent  possible.
      For this purpose,  "net pay" shall mean a  Participant's  pay from an
      Employer,   reduced  by  applicable  taxes  and  such  other  payroll
      deductions  that are  accorded  priority  by the Plan  Administrator.
      Notwithstanding  the  preceding  provisions,  direct  payment  to the
      Plan  Administrator  shall be required  in the case of a  Participant
      who is on an  authorized  leave of absence  or long term  disability,
      or  a  Participant  who  becomes  a  foreign  service  employee.  For
      purposes of this  subsection,  a loan is not  considered  outstanding
      following its default.
                  (c)  Prepayment.  A  Participant  may  prepay  his entire
      outstanding  loan balance  without  penalty after first notifying the
      Plan  Administrator.   Upon  notification,   the  Plan  Administrator
      shall  make  the  necessary  administrative  arrangements  to  permit
      repayment  and shall advise the  Participant  of the  payment-in-full
      amount and its due date. No partial  prepayments  are permitted,  and
      no payment-in-full amount will be accepted after its due date.
                                       VII-5
<PAGE>


                  (d)      Terminating      Employees.      Notwithstanding
      subsections   (a)  and  (b),  an   outstanding   loan  shall   become
      immediately  due and  payable  in full if the  borrowing  Participant
      retires,  dies or otherwise  terminates  employment.  For purposes of
      this  subsection,  a  Participant's  employment  shall be  deemed  to
      continue:  (1) while he is receiving  long term  disability  benefits
      and making  loan  repayment  directly to the Plan  Administrator,  or
      (2) while he is repaying  his loan  through  payroll  deduction  from
      salary continuation or other similar payments.
                  (e)  Termination  of  Loan  Program.  In  the  event  the
      Plan   terminates  or  the  portion  of  the  Plan  applicable  to  a
      Participant  terminates,  the Participant's loan shall become due and
      payable in full immediately.
            7.9   Loan Default.  A loan shall be in default if:
                  (a)  the  borrowing  Participant  is  delinquent  on more
      than 12 weeks of scheduled loan repayment amounts;
                  (b)  the   loan   becomes   due  and   payable   and  the
      Participant  fails  to pay  the  outstanding  principal  amount  plus
      accrued interest within 60 days;
                  (c) the  term  of the  loan  has  been  extended  to more
      than  56  months  as  a  result  of  the  Participant's   failure  or
      inability to make timely loan payments; or
                  (d) there  occurs  such other  circumstances  as the Plan
      Administrator  considers  to be a  default  in order to  protect  the
      interests of the Plan.
A  default  on a Plan  loan  occurs  on the  date  the  first  of the  preceding
conditions is met. If a default on a  Participant's  Plan loan occurs,  the Plan
shall have the right to foreclose on the Participant's  security interest in his
Account, and shall do so on or

                                       VII-6
<PAGE>


after the first distributable event for such Participant described in Article VI
(other than a hardship distribution event pursuant to Section 6.3(a)).
            7.10  Nondiscrimination.  Loans  shall  be  made  available  to
all  Participants  who meet the  requirements set forth in section 7.1 on a
reasonably  equivalent basis,  except that the Plan  Administrator may make
reasonable  distinctions  based on other  obligations  of the  Participant,
state law  requirements  affecting  payroll  deductions  and other  factors
that may adversely affect the ability to assure  repayment  through payroll
deduction.  The Plan  Administrator  may refuse a  requested  loan where it
determines that timely  repayment of the loan through payroll  deduction is
not assured.
            7.11  Collins  Food  International,  Inc.  With  respect  to  a
borrowing    Participant:    (i) who   was   employed   by   Collins   Food
International,  Inc.  before  becoming  employed by Kentucky  Fried Chicken
Corporation  and  (ii)  who has a loan  outstanding  under  the  Plan,  the
provisions  of this  Article VII shall  apply.  In  addition,  the terms of
the promissory  note for such  outstanding  loan shall govern to the extent
not in conflict with this Plan or applicable federal law.
            7.12  Miscellaneous.
                  (a)  Additional   Documentation.   A  Participant   shall
      execute   any   additional   documents   as   required  by  the  Plan
      Administrator  that  correct  ministerial  errors in the  Application
      Forms, or that are required for proper administration of the loan.
                  (b)    Agent    of   Plan    Administrator.    The   Plan
      Administrator  may  designate  an  exclusive  agent for  purposes  of
      administration  of  some  or all of the  loan  program,  and to  such
      extent any  references in this Article VII to the Plan  Administrator
      shall mean the designated agent.
               (c) Power to Amend Outstanding Loans. It is specifically intended
          that the Company's power to amend the Plan set forth in Article XI

                                       VII-7
<PAGE>

 
     applies to loans from this Plan that are  outstanding  (including  loans in
default) at the time of the amendment.

                               ARTICLE VIII
                       Determination of Beneficiary

            A   Participant's   Beneficiary   under   the  Plan   shall  be
determined   in  accordance   with  this   Article.   In  the  event  of  a
Participant's  death,  any interest of the Participant in the Plan shall be
payable to such Beneficiary in accordance with Section 6.2.
            8.1   Certain    Married    Participants:    A    Participant's
Beneficiary  shall be determined  in  accordance  with this Section if: (i)
the  Participant  is  married  on the  date  of his  death,  and  (ii)  the

            a Qualified  Designation (as hereinafter  defined) in effect on
            the date of his  death,  then  such  Participant's  Beneficiary
            shall be the person or persons  designated  by the  Participant
            in the  most  recent  Qualified  Designation  on file  with the

                              (i)   A    Participant's    Designation    of
                  Beneficiary   form   meets  the   requirements   of  this

                        in writing  by the  spouse to whom the  Participant

                        acknowledges the effect of the designation,

                                    (C)    the    spouse's    consent    is
                        witnessed  by  a  notary   public  or  an  official

                                    (D) the  designation  is  signed by the
                        Participant  and satisfies  any other  requirements
                        which are prescribed by the Plan Administrator.
                              (ii)   A    Participant's    Designation   of
                  Beneficiary   form   meets  the   requirements   of  this
                  subparagraph if:
                                    (A) at the  time  such  form is  filed,
                        it is established to the  satisfaction  of the Plan
                        Administrator  (or its  authorized  representative)
                        that the consent  required under  subparagraph  (i)
                        may  not  be  obtained  because  the  Participant's
                        spouse  cannot be  located or because of such other
                        circumstances  as  may  be  specified  by  Internal
                        Revenue Service Regulations,
                                    (B)   the    Participant   is   legally
                        separated  or the  Participant  has been  abandoned
                        (within  the  meaning  of  local  law)  and (I) the
                        Participant  has a court order to such effect,  and
                        (II)  there  is  no  qualified  domestic  relations
                        order  (within the meaning of Code section  414(p))
                        which    requires    spousal    consent    to   the
                        Participant's  elections  covered by this  section,
                        and
                                    (C) the  designation  is  signed by the
                        Participant  and satisfies  any other  requirements
                        which are prescribed by the Plan Administrator.
     Consent by a spouse,  or  establishment  that a spouse's  consent cannot be
     obtained,  shall be effective only with respect to such individual  spouse.
     If the spouse is legally incompetent to give consent,  consent may be given
     by the spouse's legal guardian (even if the guardian is the
                                       VIII-2

            Participant).  Once a spouse has given  consent to an  election
            of the Participant, such consent shall be irrevocable.
                        (2)  No  Qualified  Designation:  If a  Participant
            covered by this  Section  dies after  November  13,  1984,  and
            does not have a  Qualified  Designation  in  effect on the date
            of  his  death,   then   notwithstanding   any  Designation  of
            Beneficiary  form  the  Participant  may have  completed,  such
            Participant's   sole   Beneficiary   shall  be  his  spouse.  A
            Participant's  Qualified  Designation  shall not be  considered
            to be in effect hereunder if all the  Participant's  designated
            Beneficiaries have predeceased the Participant.
                  (b) Deaths  Before  November 14, 1984:  If a  Participant
      described  in this  Section  dies  before  November  14,  1984,  then
      notwithstanding  any Designation of Beneficiary  form the Participant
      may have completed,  such  Participant's  Beneficiary for one-half of
      his interest in the Plan shall be such  Participant's  spouse. If the
      amount  payable  to  the   Participant's   spouse   pursuant  to  the
      preceding  sentence would exceed  $3,500,  then  notwithstanding  any
      other   provision    contained   herein,   such   one-half   of   the
      Participant's  interest  shall be  payable  to the  spouse  as a life
      annuity  unless the spouse  consents  in writing to the  distribution
      of  such  amount  as a  lump  sum.  The  remaining  one-half  of  the
      Participant's   interest   in  the  Plan  shall  be  payable  to  the
      Participant's  Beneficiary  determined in accordance with Section 8.2
      (as if such Section applied with respect to the Participant).
            8.2  Other  Participants:  A  Participant's  Beneficiary  shall
be determined in accordance  with this Section if: (i) the  Participant  is
not  married  on the  date of his  death,  or (ii) the  Participant  is not
credited with an Hour of Service after August 22, 1984.
     (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) below, the Beneficiary of
     a  Participant  covered  by this  Section  shall be the  person or  persons
     designated by the Participant on the most recent Designation of Beneficiary
     form on

      form shall not be taken into  account  under this  section  unless it
      has been signed by the Participant.
                  (b)  In  the  case  of  a  Participant  covered  by  this
      Section  who is  married at death,  any  Designation  of  Beneficiary
      form executed by such  Participant  after December 31, 1984 shall not
      be effective  hereunder  unless such form meets the  requirements  of
      Section 8.1(a)(1)(i) or (ii).
                  (c)  In  the  event  benefits  became  payable  upon  the
      death of a Participant  described in this Section and no  Beneficiary
      has been  properly  designated  as  provided in  subsections  (a) and
      (b), or if all such designated  Beneficiaries  shall have predeceased
      the Participant,  then the Participant's  sole Beneficiary  hereunder
      shall be his estate.

                              Administration

            9.1 Allocation of  Responsibility  Among  Fiduciaries for Plan 
and Trust  Administration:  The Fiduciaries  shall have only those specific
powers,  duties,  responsibilities,  and  obligations  as are  specifically
given   them   under   this  Plan  or  the  Trust   instrument.   The  Plan
Administrator  shall have the sole  responsibility  for the  administration
of the Plan, which  responsibility  is specifically  described in this Plan
and the Trust  instrument,  except  where an agent is  appointed to perform
administrative  duties as specifically  agreed to by the Plan Administrator
and the agent.  Subject to Section  5.2(c)(1),  the Trustee  shall have the
sole   responsibility   for  the   administration  of  the  Trust  and  the
management of the assets held under the Trust as  specifically  provided in
the  Trust  instrument,   except  where  an  investment  manager  has  been
appointed  or  as  provided   otherwise  in  the  Trust  instrument.   Each
Fiduciary  warrants that any directions given,  information  furnished,  or
action taken by it shall be in accordance  with the  provisions of the Plan
or the Trust instrument,  as the case may be,  authorizing or providing for
such  direction,  information  or action.  Furthermore,  each Fiduciary may
rely upon any  direction,  information  or action of another  Fiduciary  as
being proper under this Plan or the Trust,  and is not required  under this
Plan  or  the  Trust  instrument  to  inquire  into  the  propriety  of any
direction,  information  or action.  It is intended under this Plan and the
Trust  instrument  that each Fiduciary  shall be responsible for the proper
exercise  of its  own  powers,  duties,  responsibilities  and  obligations
under this Plan and the Trust  instrument and shall not be responsible  for
any act or failure to act of another  Fiduciary.  No  Fiduciary  guarantees
the Trust in any manner against  investment  loss or  depreciation in asset
value.
            9.2  Administration:  The  Plan  shall  be  administered  by the
Plan  Administrator  which may  appoint or employ  individuals  to assist in
the  administration  of the Plan and which may  appoint  or employ any other
agents it deems advisable,  including legal counsel,  actuaries and auditors
to serve at the Plan  Administrator's  direction.  All usual and  reasonable
expenses of maintaining, operating
and  administering  the Plan and the Trust,  including  the  expenses of the
Plan Administrator and the
                                       IX-1
<PAGE>

                                      
Trustee (and their agents),  shall be paid from the Trust (whether  directly
or by  reimbursement  to the Company or the Employer),  except to the extent
the Company or the Employer elect to pay such expenses.
            9.3  Claims  Procedure:  The  Plan  Administrator,  or  a  party
designated   by  the  Plan   Administrator,   shall   have   the   exclusive
discretionary  authority to construe and to  interpret  the Plan,  to decide
all  questions of  eligibility  for benefits and to determine  the amount of
such  benefits,  and its decision on such matters are final and  conclusive.
Any exercise of this  discretionary  authority  shall be reviewed by a court
under  the  arbitrary  and  capricious   standard,   (i.e.,   the  abuse  of
discretion  standard).  If,  pursuant to this  discretionary  authority,  an
assertion  of any right to a benefit  by a  Participant  or  beneficiary  is
wholly or partially denied,  the Plan  Administrator,  or a party designated
by the Plan  Administrator,  will  provide  such  claimant a  comprehensible
written notice setting forth:
                  (a)  The specific reason or reasons for such denial;
                  (b) Specific  reference to pertinent  Plan  provisions  on
      which the denial is based;
                  (c)  A   description   of  any   additional   material  or
      information  necessary  for the  claimant  to  submit to  perfect  the
      claim  and an  explanation  of why such  material  or  information  is
      necessary; and
                  (d)   A   description   of   the   Plan's   claim   review
      procedure.  The claim  review  procedure  is  available  upon  written
      request by the claimant to the Plan  Administrator,  or the designated
      party,  within  60 days  after  receipt  by the  claimant  of  written
      notice of the denial of the claim,  and  includes the right to examine
      pertinent  documents  and submit issues and comments in writing to the
      Plan  Administrator,  or the designated  party. The decision on review
      will be made  within 60 days after  receipt of the request for review,
      unless  circumstances  warrant an  extension  of time not to exceed an
      additional  60 days,  and shall be in writing  and drafted in a manner
      calculated to be
                                       IX-2
<PAGE>

       understood by the claimant,  and include specific reasons for the
      decision with  references to the specific Plan provisions on which
      the decision is based.
If  circumstances  warrant,  the Plan  Administrator  shall  provide the
claimant a written  notice,  prior to the end of the  90-day  period for
processing  the claim,  extending  such period by up to an additional 90
days and  indicating the  circumstances  requiring the extension and the
date by which the Plan  Administrator  expects to render  its  decision.
If the Plan  Administrator  fails to  provide a  comprehensible  written
notice stating that the claim is wholly or partially  denied and setting
forth the  information  described  in (a) through  (d) above  within the
90-day  processing  period and if no extension of such 90-day  period is
made,  the  claim  shall be  deemed  denied.  Once the  claim is  deemed
denied,   the  Participant  shall  be  entitled  to  the  claims  review
procedure  described  in  subsection  (d) above.  Such review  procedure
shall be  available  upon  written  request by the  claimant to the Plan
Administrator  within 60 days  after the  claim is  deemed  denied.  Any
claim   referenced  in  this  section  that  is  reviewed  by  a  court,
arbitrator,  or any other tribunal shall be reviewed solely on the basis
of the  record  before the Plan  Administrator.  In  addition,  any such
review shall be conditioned on the claimants  having fully exhausted all
rights under this section.
            9.4  Records  and  Reports:  The  Plan  Administrator  shall
exercise such authority and  responsibility  as it deems  appropriate in
order to comply with ERISA and government  regulations issued thereunder
relating   to   records   of   Participants'   service   and   benefits;
notifications  to  Participants;  reports to, or registration  with, the
Internal Revenue  Service;  reports to the Department of Labor; and such
other documents and reports as may be required by ERISA.

      eligibility  and determine the amount,  manner and time of payment
      of any benefits hereunder;
                  (b)  To  prescribe   procedures   to  be  followed  by
      Participants or Beneficiaries filing applications for benefits;
                  (c) To prepare and  distribute,  in such manner as the
      Plan  Administrator  determines  to  be  appropriate,  information
      explaining the Plan;
                  (d) To  receive  from  employees  and  agents and from
      Participants  such  information  as  shall  be  necessary  for the
      proper administration of the Plan;
                  (e) To  receive,  review and keep on file (as it deems
      convenient or proper) reports of the financial  condition,  and of
      the receipts and disbursements, of the Trust from the Trustee;
                  (f)  To  appoint  or  employ   individuals   or  other
      parties to assist in the  administration of the Plan and any other
      agents it deems advisable,  including  accountants,  actuaries and
      legal counsel; and
                  (g) To delegate to other  persons or  entities,  or to
      designate  or  employ  persons  to  carry  out  any  of  the  Plan
      Administrator's  fiduciary  duties  or  responsibilities  or other

            9.6 Rules and Decisions:  The Plan  Administrator  may adopt
such  rules  and  procedures  as  it  deems  necessary,   desirable,  or
appropriate.  To the extent practicable,  all rules and decisions of the
Plan  Administrator  shall be uniformly and consistently  applied to all
Participants in similar  circumstances.  When making a determination  or
calculation,  the Plan  Administrator  shall be  entitled  to rely  upon
information  furnished  by  a  Participant  or  beneficiary,  the  legal
counsel of the Plan Administrator, or the Trustee.
            9.7  Procedures:  The  Plan  Administrator  shall  keep  all
necessary  records  and  forward  all  necessary  communications  to the
Trustee.  The Plan  Administrator may adopt such regulations as it deems
desirable for the administration of the Plan.

            9.8  Authorization  of  Benefit   Distributions:   The  Plan
Administrator  shall  issue  directions  to the Trustee  concerning  all
benefits  which are to be paid from the Trust pursuant to the provisions
of  the  Plan,  and  shall  warrant  that  all  such  directions  are in

            All  contributions  made by the  Employers,  or the  Company  on
behalf of the  Employers,  under this Plan shall be paid to the  Trustee and
deposited  in the Trust Fund or with an  insurance  company  or a  financial
institution  pursuant  to a contract to be held and  invested in  accordance
with the Trust  instrument.  Assets of other plans maintained by the PepsiCo

                           Amendment of the Plan

            The Company  shall have the right at any time by  instrument  in
writing,  duly executed and  acknowledged  and delivered to the Trustee,  to
modify,  alter or amend  this Plan in whole or in part.  However,  except as
permissible under the Code and ERISA, no amendment shall:
                  (a)  Reduce  the  amounts  in  any  Participant's  Account
      because  of  forfeiture  or reduce  the vested  right or  interest  to
      which any  Participant  or  Beneficiary  is then  entitled  under this
      Plan;
                  (b)  Eliminate  an optional  form of benefit  with respect
      to a Participant's Account as of the date of the amendment;

      diverted  to,  purposes  other  than  for  the  exclusive  benefit  of

      required to pay taxes and expenses of administration).
To the extent  permitted  under the Code,  the Company  shall have the right
to  amend  the  Plan  at any  time,  retroactively  or  otherwise,  in  such

existing and applicable  laws and  regulations in order to make available to
the Employers the tax benefits  associated with qualified  plans,  including
the full  deduction  for tax  purposes of the  Employer  contributions  made
hereunder.  A  participating  Employer shall not have the right to amend the
Plan.  Notwithstanding  any provision  herein to the  contrary,  the Company
may  by  such  amendment   decrease  or  otherwise   affect  the  rights  of
Participants  hereunder if, and to the extent,  necessary to accomplish such
purpose.

direction  of the Plan  Administrator  to  handle  the  assets  of the Trust
Fund, as follows:
            First, to the extent  determined by the Plan  Administrator,  to
pay any due and  accrued  expenses  and  liabilities  of the  Trust  and any
expenses involved in the termination.
            Second,  to pay to  Participants  in the  Plan  who  are  active
Employees  affected by such  termination the amount of their interest in the
Trust Fund,  as soon as permitted by  applicable  law, as  determined by the
Plan  Administrator.  If some  or all of the  Participants  may not  receive
distributions  of  their  interest  at  the  time  of  such  termination  or
cessation,  the Plan  Administrator  may in its sole  discretion  direct the
Trustee  to  segregate  each  such  Participant's   interest  to  a  savings
account,   certificate  of  deposit,   or  other  suitable   investment  for
distribution at the appropriate future time.
            Notwithstanding   the  foregoing,   the  Trustee  shall  not  be
required  to make any  distribution  from the Trust in the event the Plan is
terminated  until  such time as the  Internal  Revenue  Service  shall  have
determined in writing that such  termination  will not adversely  affect the
prior qualification of the Plan.
            In the event of a  termination  or partial  termination  of this
Plan instituted  either by the Company or the Internal Revenue  Service,  or
in the  event of a  complete  discontinuance  of  contributions  under  this
Plan,  the right of each  affected  Participant  to benefits  accrued to the
date  of  such   termination,   to  the  extent   then   funded,   shall  be
nonforfeitable.  In  the  case  of a  partial  termination,  this  provision
shall  apply  only  to the  portion  of the  Plan  terminated  and  only  to
Participants affected by such partial termination.

                               Miscellaneous

            13.1  Participants'  Rights;  Acquittance:  Except to the extent
required or  provided  for by a  mandatory  law as in effect and  applicable
hereto from time to time,  neither  the  establishment  of the Trust  hereby
created,  nor any  modification  thereof,  nor the  creation  of any fund or
account,  nor the  payment  of any  distributions,  shall  be  construed  as
giving to any  Participant  or other  person  any legal or  equitable  right
against the  Employer,  or any officer or employee  thereof,  or the Trustee
or  the  Plan  Administrator  except  as  herein  provided;  nor  shall  any
Participant  have any legal  right,  title or  interest in this Trust or any
of its  assets,  except in the  event and to the  extent  that  amounts  may
actually be distributable to him hereunder,  and the same limitations  shall
be  applicable  with  respect  to  distributions  upon  death  which  may be
payable  to the  Beneficiaries  of a  Participant.  Under  no  circumstances
shall the terms of employment of any  Participant  be modified or in any way
affected  hereby.  This Plan and Trust  shall not  constitute  a contract of
employment  nor  afford  any  individual  any  right to be  retained  in the
employ of the Employer.
            13.2  Nonalienation of Benefits:
                  (a) In  General:  Except as  provided  in  subsection  (b)
      below,  benefits  payable  under this Plan shall not be subject in any
      manner  to  anticipation,   alienation,  sale,  transfer,  assignment,
      pledge, encumbrance,  charge,  garnishment,  execution, or levy of any
      kind,   either   voluntary   or   involuntary,   and  any  attempt  to
      anticipate,   alienate,  sell,  transfer,  assign,  pledge,  encumber,
      charge  or  otherwise   dispose  of  any  right  to  benefits  payable
      hereunder,  shall be void.  The Trust  Fund shall not in any manner be
      liable  for,  or  subject  to,  the  debts,  contracts,   liabilities,
      engagements or torts of any person entitled to benefits hereunder.
                  (b)  Qualified  Domestic  Relations  Orders:  To the
      extent  mandated by law,  the Plan  Administrator  shall  comply
      with a qualified  domestic  relations  order, as defined by Code
      section  414(p)(1)(A),  which  requires  that  all or  part of a
      Participant's
                                       XIII-1
<PAGE>

      interest  in the  Plan  be  paid  to an  alternate  payee,  i.e.,  the
      spouse,   former   spouse,   child   or   other   dependent   of  such
      Participant.  If  the  Plan  Administrator  receives  an  order  which
      purports  to  be  a  qualified  domestic  relations  order,  the  Plan
      Administrator  shall in accordance  with such  procedures and rules as
      it  may  establish:   (i)  determine  the  qualified  status  of  such
      qualified domestic  relations order under Code section 414(p)(6),  and
      (ii) if satisfied that the qualified  domestic  relations  order meets
      the  requirements  of Code  section  414(p),  direct  the  Trustee  to
      comply with the  qualified  domestic  relations  order and pay amounts
      from the Trust Fund in  accordance  therewith.  A  qualified  domestic
      relations  order may not  require the Plan to make a  distribution  to
      an  alternate  payee  prior  to the date  the  Participant  terminates
      employment or, if earlier,  the date the  Participant  attains age 50.
      However,  the Plan  may  make a  distribution  to an  alternate  payee
      prior  to  such  date  in  accordance  with  permissive   terms  of  a
      qualified  domestic  relations  order.  Except as otherwise  expressly
      provided  in a qualified  domestic  relations  order,  no consent by a
      Participant  or  alternate  payee shall be  required  in applying  the
      provisions  of Section  6.6 to an  alternate  payee's  interest in the
      Plan.  For  purposes of the  investment  options  under  Article V and
      the  determination  of the amount of a distribution  under Article VI,
      an alternate  payee,  with respect to his interest in the Plan,  shall
      be treated as a Participant would with respect to his Account.
Neither the Plan,  the Company,  the Employer,  the Plan  Administrator  nor
the  Trustee  shall be liable in any  manner to any  person,  including  any
Participant or  Beneficiary,  for complying with a domestic  relations order
that is considered a qualified  domestic  relations order in accordance with
the provisions of Code section 414(p).
            13.3   Actions   Involving   the   Trust:   In  any   action  or
proceeding  involving the Trust Fund, or any property  constituting  part or
all thereof, or the administration  thereof, the Company, the Employer,  the
Plan  Administrator,  and the Trustee  shall be the only  necessary  parties
and  no   employees   or  former   employees   of  the   Employer  or  their
Beneficiaries or any
                                       XIII-2
<PAGE>


other  person  having or  claiming  to have an interest in the Trust Fund or
under the Plan shall be entitled to any notice or service of process.

            Any final  judgment  which is not  appealed or  appealable  that
may be  entered  in any such  action  or  proceeding  shall be  binding  and
conclusive on the parties hereto,  the Plan  Administrator,  the Trustee and
all persons  having or  claiming  to have any  interest in the Trust Fund or
under the Plan.
            13.4  [Reserved]
            13.5   Successor   to  the   Company:   In  the   event  of  the
dissolution,   merger,  consolidation  or  reorganization  of  the  Company,
provision  may be made by which the Plan and Trust will be  continued by the
successor;  and, in that event,  such successor shall be substituted for the
Company under the Plan. The  substitution of the successor shall  constitute
an assumption of Plan  liabilities by the successor and the successor  shall
have all the powers,  duties and  responsibilities  of the Company under the
Plan.
            13.6  Transfer  of Plan  Assets:  In the event of any  merger or
consolidation  of the  Plan  with,  or  transfer  in whole or in part of the
assets and  liabilities of the Trust Fund to another trust fund,  held under
any other plan of  deferred  compensation  maintained  or to be  established
for the  benefit  of all or  some of the  Participants  of  this  Plan,  the
assets  of  the  Trust  Fund  applicable  to  such  Participants   shall  be
transferred to the other trust fund only if:
                  (a)   Each  Participant  would, if either this Plan or the
      other plan then terminated,  receive a benefit  immediately  after the
      merger,  consolidation  or transfer  which is equal to or greater than
      the  benefit  he would  have  been  entitled  to  receive  immediately
      before the merger,  consolidation  or  transfer,  if the Plan had then
      terminated;
                  (b)   Resolutions   of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the
      Employer of the affected  Participants,  shall authorize such transfer
      of assets;  and, in the case of the new or  successor  employer of the
      affected  Participants,  its  resolutions  shall include an assumption
      of  liabilities  with respect to such  Participant's  inclusion in the
      new employer's plan, and
                  (c)   Such  other  plan  and  trust  are  qualified  under
      sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code.
                                       XIII-3
<PAGE>

            13.7  Indemnification:  Unless  the  Board of  Directors  of the
Company  shall  determine  otherwise,  the Company shall  indemnify,  to the
full extent  permitted by law, any employee  acting in good faith within the
scope of his employment in carrying out the administration of the Plan.
            13.8  Action  by  the  Company:   Any  action  by  the  Company,
including  any  amendment  authorized  to be made under Article XI, shall be
made by a  resolution  adopted  by the  Company's  Board  of  Directors.  In
addition,  any person or persons  authorized by the Board may take action on
behalf  of the  Company.  Any such  resolution  of the  Board  of  Directors
shall be  effective  provided  it is adopted in  accordance  with the bylaws
(or other  governing  authority)  of the  Company.  Any action  taken by any
other  person or persons  shall be  effective  provided  it is  executed  in
accordance with the authorization of the Board.
            13.9  Applicable Law:  The provisions of the Plan shall be
construed and administered according to, and its validity and
enforceability shall be determined under, ERISA.  In the event ERISA does
not preempt state law in a particular circumstance, the laws of the State
of New York shall govern.
            13.10 Interpreting  the  Plan:  This Plan  shall be  interpreted
in accordance with the rules of this section and Section 2.2.
                  (a)   Compounds  of the Word "Here":  The words  "hereof",
      "hereunder"  and other  similar  compounds  of the word  "here"  shall
      mean and refer to the entire  Plan,  not to any  particular  provision
      or section.
                  (b)   Examples:  Whenever  an example is  provided  or the
      text uses the term  "including"  followed by a specific item or items,
      or there is a passage  having  similar  effect,  such  passages of the
      Plan  shall  be  construed  as  if  the  phrase  "without  limitation"
      followed  such example or term (or  otherwise  applied to such passage
      in a manner that avoids limits on its breadth of application).
                  (c)   Fiduciary  Discretion:   With  respect  to  the  powers,
      duties and  responsibilities  allocated to the named Fiduciaries under the
      Plan, the Plan Administrator and the Trustee shall
      have full  discretionary  authority to implement  and perform such powers,
      duties and responsibilities.

                                       XIII-4
<PAGE>

      Specific  references  in the  Plan  to  the  Plan  Administrator's  or the
      Trustee's  discretion  in a particular  context  shall create no inference
      that  the  Plan  Administrator's  or  Trustee's  discretion  in any  other
      respect,  or in connection with any other provisions,  is less complete or
      broad.
                  (d)   Invalid  Provisions:  If any  provision of this Plan is,
      or is  hereafter  declared  to be void,  voidable,  invalid  or  otherwise
      unlawful, the remainder of the Plan shall not be affected thereby.

                                    ARTICLE XIV
                             Top-Heavy Plan Provisions

            14.1  Application:  In the event that the Plan is  determined  to be
a  Top-Heavy  Plan (as  hereinafter  defined),  this  Article  XIV shall  become
effective  as of the  first  day  of the  Plan  Year  in  which  the  Plan  is a
Top-Heavy Plan.
            14.2  Definitions:
                  (a)  Key  Employee:  During  any  year  that  the  Plan  is  a
      Top-Heavy  Plan, an Employee  (including  any  Beneficiary of an Employee)
      is a Key  Employee  if, at any time  during  the Plan Year or any of the 4
      preceding Plan Years, he is (or was):
                        (1)  An   officer   of   the   Employer   whose   Annual
            Compensation  (as  hereinafter  defined)  exceeds  50 percent of the
            dollar  limitation  in  effect  for such  year  under  Code  section
            415(b)(1)(A);
                        (2)   One   of   the   10   employees    having   Annual
            Compensation  of more than the dollar  limitation in effect for such
            year under Code section  415(c)(1)(A),  having individual  ownership
            interests  in the  Employer  of  more  than  1/2 of 1  percent,  and
            owning the largest interests in the Employer;
                        (3) A 1  percent  owner of the  Employer  having  Annual
            Compensation from the Employer of more than $150,000; or
                    (4) A 5 percent  owner of the Employer.  Ownership  shall be
               determined according to Code section  416(i)(1)(B).  For purposes
               of paragraph  (1) above,  no more than 50 Employees  (or if less,
               the greater of 3 or 10 percent of the Employees) shall be treated
               as officers.  For purposes of paragraph (2) above, if 2 Employees
               have the same  ownership  interest,  the Employee with the higher
               Annual  Compensation  shall  be  treated  as  having  the  larger
               interest.  For  purposes of Paragraph  (1),  (2) and (3),  annual
               compensation  means  compensation  as  defined  in  Code  section
               415(c)(3), but including amounts contributed by the Employer
                                       XIV-1

<PAGE>
                                 
      pursuant to a salary  reduction  agreement  which are excludable  from
      the employee's gross income under Code section 125 or 402(a)(8).
                  (b)  Minimum  Contribution  - For a Plan Year,  the lesser
      of 3 percent of a Participant's  Annual  Compensation or, if this Plan
      does not enable a defined  benefit  plan in the  Required  Aggregation
      Group  (as  determined  below) to  satisfy  the  requirements  of Code
      section  401(a)(4)  or 410, a  percentage  of a  Participant's  Annual
      Compensation  equal to the percentage at which  contributions are made
      (or  required  to be made)  under the Plan and all other  plans in the
      Required  Aggregation  Group (as defined  below) for the Key  Employee
      for whom such percentage is highest.
                  (c)  Top-Heavy  Plan:  For any Plan Year  beginning  after
      December  31,  1983,  a plan that is  required in such year to satisfy
      the  requirements  of Code  section 416 because the  aggregate  of the
      account  balances of all Key  Employees in the Plan exceeds 60 percent
      of the aggregate of the account  balances of all  Participants  in the
      Plan,   such   determination   to  be  made  in  accordance  with  the
      procedures  described  in Code  section  416(g)  and  the  regulations
      thereunder  as of the last day of the  preceding  Plan Year (or in the
      case of the first  Plan  Year,  as of the last day of such Plan  Year)
      (the  "determination  date"). For purposes of determining  whether the
      Plan is a Top-Heavy  Plan, the Plan must be aggregated  with all other
      plans  maintained by the Employer  which are required to be aggregated
      with the Plan in order for the Plan to meet the  requirements  of Code
      sections  401(a)(4)  or 410,  and all other  plans  maintained  by the
      Employer  in which a Key  Employee  is a  Participant  (the  "Required
      Aggregation  Group").  In  addition,  the Plan may also be  aggregated
      with  any  other  plans  maintained  by the  Employer  so long as such
      aggregation  would not prevent the  aggregated  group from  satisfying
      the  requirements of Code sections  401(a)(4) or 410 (the  "Permissive
      Aggregation Group").
     14.3 Allocation of Minimum Contribution:  For any year in which the Plan is
a Top-Heavy Plan, the Minimum  Contribution as defined in Section 14.2(b) hereof
shall be made to the  account  of each  Participant  who is a non-Key  Employee,
unless the  Participant  accrues the defined  benefit  minimum  required by Code
section  416 for such  year  under a  defined  benefit  plan  maintained  by the
Employer. Such Minimum Contribution shall be made to the account of each non-Key
Employee  Participant  who is employed on the last day of such Plan Year without
regard to such Participant's Hours of Service during such Plan Year. The 
                                       XIV-2
<PAGE>

     Employer and the Plan Administrator  shall determine under which plan a
Participant  shall  receive  the  Minimum  Contribution  if  the  Employee  is a
Participant in more than one plan maintained by the Employer.
     14.4  Vesting:  If for any  Plan  Year  the  Plan is a  Top-Heavy  Plan,  a
Participant's  vested  interest in the Plan for such Plan Year and all preceding
Plan Years  shall not be less than as  determined  under the  following  vesting
schedule:

    Years of                   Vested                  Forfeited
    Service                    Percentage              Percentage

  Less than 2                    0%                   100%
       2                        20%                    80%
       3                        40%                    60%
       4                        60%                    40%
       5 or more               100%                     0%


     If the Plan ceases to be a  Top-Heavy  Plan,  the vesting  schedule in this
Section  14.4 shall not apply,  provided  that any portion of the  Participant's
interest  in the Plan that was  nonforfeitable  before  the Plan  ceases to be a
Top-Heavy  Plan shall  remain  nonforfeitable,  and  further  provided  that any
Participant who has 3 or more Years of Service at the time the Plan ceases to be
a Top-Heavy  Plan shall have the right to elect during the  Election  Period (as
hereinafter  defined)  to  continue to have his vested  interest  determined  in
accordance with the vesting schedule contained in this Section 14.4.
     For the  purposes of this  Section  14.4,  Years of Service  shall  include
service  prior to the  Effective  Date,  and shall  include  service  during the
Election  Period.  The  Election  Period  shall be the period  during which such
Participant may make such vesting schedule  election and shall begin on the date
of the adoption of the amendment  which  changes the vesting  schedule and shall
end on the latest of:
     (a) The date which is 60 days after the  adoption  of the  amendment  which
changes the vesting schedule;
     (b) The date which is 60 days  after the  effective  date of the  amendment
which changes the vesting schedule; or
     (c) The date which is 60 days after the date such  Participant  is notified
in writing of the amendment which changes the vesting schedule.

                                  Article A
                                KFC - Collins
            The terms of this  Article  apply to  certain  Plan  Participants
who  were  employees  of  Collins  Foods  International,  Inc.  and who  were
Participants in the Collins Food  International,  Inc.  Employee Savings Plan
on March 17, 1991.  The effective  date of this  amendment is March 17, 1991,
the date Collins Foods  International,  Inc. was merged into  Kentucky  Fried
Chicken  Corporation.  As of the merger,  Participants  were entitled to make
investment  directions into the Kentucky Fried Chicken  Corporation Long Term
Savings Program.  If no investment  election was received,  the Participant's
account  was  transferred  to the  Security  Plus Fund.  The  Kentucky  Fried
Chicken  Corporation  Long Term  Savings  Program was merged into the PepsiCo
Long Term Savings Program effective December 31, 1991.
            A.1  Definitions:   The  following  words  and  phrases  as  used
herein,  have the respective  meanings set forth in this Article,  unless the
context clearly indicates to the contrary.
                  (a)  Collins:  Collins Food International, Inc.
                  (b)  Savings Plan:      Collins  Food  International,  Inc.
      Employee Savings Plan.
                  (c)  Closing Date:      March 17, 1991
                  (d)  Account  Balance:  The  amount in the  account of each
      Participant in the Savings Plan as of the Closing Date.
                  (e)   Voluntary   Contribution:   The  amount   voluntarily
      contributed  to the Savings Plan by a  Participant  prior to January 1,
      1987.
                  (f)  Voluntary   Contribution  Account  The  account  of  a
      Participant  to which  his  Voluntary  Contributions  and the gains and
      losses thereon are credited.
            A.2  Participants  Covered by this  Appendix:  As of the  Closing
Date,  Employees  of Collins  who  participated  in the  Savings  Plan became
Participants  in the Kentucky  Fried  Chicken  Corporation  Long Term Savings
Program if the  Participant  had an Account Balance in the Savings Plan as of
the  Closing  Date.  In  addition,  individuals  described  in the  preceding
sentence  became  Participants  in this Plan as of December  31, 1991 if they
had an account  balance in the Kentucky Fried Chicken  Corporation  Long Term
Savings  Program as of December 31,  1991.  Each  Participant  in the Savings
Plan as of the Closing Date became fully vested in his Account Balance.
            A.3   Voluntary    Contributions:    A   Participant   may   make
withdrawals  from  his  Voluntary  Contribution  Account  from  time to time,
subject to reasonable  procedures as the Plan  Administrator  may  establish.
Withdrawals  of Voluntary  Contributions  shall consist only of the principal
amount credited to the Participant's Voluntary Contribution Account.
            A.4 Plan Loans:  Effective  as of the Closing  Date,  no new plan
loans shall be available  under the Kentucky Fried Chicken  Corporation  Long
Term  Savings  Program and this Plan and no existing  loans may be renewed or
extended.  Plan  loans  that  were  made  under  the  Savings  Plan,  and are
outstanding  as  of  the  Closing  Date,   are  expressly   authorized  as  a
permissible  investment  under the Kentucky  Fried Chicken  Corporation  Long
Term Savings  Program and this Plan in  accordance  with (and subject to) the
following provisions of this section.
                  (a) The program of Plan loans  authorized  by this  section
      shall be administered by the Plan Administrator (or its delegate).
                  (b) Plan loans shall bear a  reasonable  rate of  interest,
      the amount to be determined  from time to time in  accordance  with the
      rules and  procedures  in effect  under the Savings Plan on the Closing
      Date.  The term of any loan  shall  be that in  effect  for the loan on
      the Closing Date.
                  (c) A loan  shall  continue  to be repaid in the  manner in
      effect on the Closing  Date,  provided  that  interest and principal on
      the loan must be repaid through  payroll  deduction  installments  (not
      less  frequently  than  quarterly)  over a total  period  not to exceed
      4-1/2  years  (including  renewals  and  extensions).  Loan  repayments
      shall  be  invested  in  accordance  with  the  Participant's   current
      investment  direction  for Salary  Deferral  Contributions.  If no such
      election  is in  effect,  repayments  shall be  invested  in the manner
      specified by the Plan Administrator from time to time.
                  (d) A loan shall be  documented  by such  notes,  evidences
      of indebtedness,  security  agreements and other  instruments  executed
      by the Participant as the Plan Administrator may require.
                  (e)  A  loan  shall   constitute   an  investment  of  only
      amounts  credited  to the  Account of the  borrowing  Participant.  All
      gains  and  losses  on a  loan  shall  be  credited  to  the  borrowing
      Participant's Account.
                  (f) A loan  shall  be  adequately  secured  at  all  times.
      All  loans  are  secured  by a  portion  of a  borrowing  Participant's
      Account  (but not more  than  the  lesser  of:  (1) 50  percent  of the
      Account,  or (2) the amount of the loan).  To the extent the  principal
      amount of the loan  (immediately  after its  origination,  extension or
      renewal)  does not exceed 50 percent  of the  Participant's  Account at
      such  time,  the loan  will be  deemed to be  adequately  secured.  Any
      additional  loan amount must at all times be secured by other  security
      of a type and value that would be  accepted by  commercial  lenders for
      such purpose.
                  (g) A loan  shall be in default  if the  Participant  fails
      to  make  any  payment   when  due  or  if  there   occurs  such  other
      circumstances  as may be  prescribed  by the Plan  Administrator.  If a
      loan is in default,  execution on the defaulting  Participant's Account
      shall  be   accomplished   when  and  to  the  extent  the  Account  is
      distributed  to the  Participant  hereunder.  Execution  on  any  other
      security of the  Participant  shall be  accomplished at the time deemed
      necessary by the Plan Administrator to prevent a loss to the Plan.
                  (h) If a  Participant  has a  Termination  of Employment or
      dies,   any  loan   outstanding   to  the   Participant   shall  become
      immediately  due. If the portion of a  Participant's  Account  securing
      his loan otherwise becomes payable to the Participant  hereunder,  such
      loan shall  become due to the extent this  portion of the Account is to
      be  distributed.  In either  case,  the  amount of the loan that is due
      shall  be  satisfied  by  applying   against  it  the  portion  of  the
      Participant's  Account  that  secures the loan.  In turn,  such Account
      shall be  correspondingly  reduced prior to making the  distribution to
      or on behalf of the Participant.

                                  ARTICLE B
                            KFC Hourly Employees

The terms of this  Article  apply to any Employee who is employed on or after
December  1, 1989 on an hourly  basis by KFC  Corporation;  KFC  Enterprises,
Inc.; KFC National Management Company;  Kentucky Fried Chicken  International
Holdings,  Inc.;  Kentucky Fried Chicken Corporate  Holdings,  Ltd.; Kentucky
Fried  Chicken  Corporation  or the  Company  (only  with  respect  to  those
Employees  of the  Company  who are (i)  providing  services  in  Illinois to
Kentucky  Fried Chicken  Corporation  and (ii) working under the  supervision
of Kentucky Fried Chicken Corporation) (collectively referred to as "KFC").
            B.1    Modifications   to   Article   III:   To   determine   the
eligibility  to  participate  in the  Plan  of an  Employee  covered  by this
Article, Section 3.1(a) shall be modified to read as follows:
                  "(a)  General  Rule:  An  hourly  Employee  of  KFC  who is
      employed   on  or  after   December   1,  1989  shall  be  eligible  to
      participate in the Plan on and after such date as follows:
                        "(1)  Effective  for periods  before July 1, 1995, if
            he  is  either  a   full-time   hourly   Employee  of  KFC  whose
            Employment  Commencement  Date  is  before  1992  or a  full-time
            hourly  Employee  of KFC who is coded as a shift  supervisor  and
            whose Employment Commencement Date is after 1991, or
                        "(2)  Effective  beginning  July 1, 1995, if he is an
            hourly  Employee of KFC.  Any such  hourly  Employee of KFC shall
            be considered to be described in Section  3.1(c) and,  therefore,
            shall be  subject to the age 21 and year of  eligibility  service
            requirements in Sections 3.2 and 3.3."
In  addition,  Section  3.2(a)(2)  shall  read as  follows  with  respect  to
individuals who are eligible Employees pursuant to this Article B:
                        "(2)    The     following     rules    shall    apply
            notwithstanding paragraph (1) above.
                        "(i)  For  purposes  of  Employees   eligible   under
                  Section   B.1(a)  of  the  Appendix,   the  election  of  a
                  full-time   hourly   Employee   of  KFC  whose   Employment
                  Commencement  Date is before  1992  shall not be  effective
                  until he has enrolled in his  Employer's  One Plus program,
                  and the  election of a  full-time  hourly  Employee  who is
                  coded  as  a  shift   supervisor   and   whose   Employment
                  Commencement  Date is after  1991  shall  not be  effective
                  until  he has  attained  age 21 and  completed  one Year of
                  Service.
                              "(ii)  The  election  of an  Employee  eligible
                  under  Appendix   Section B.1(b)  shall  not  be  effective
                  before  the  first  January  1  or  July  1  following  his
                  attainment  of age  21 and  his  completion  of a  12-month
                  period  (measured  as  described  below)  in  which  he  is
                  credited  with at least  1,000  Hours of Service  (referred
                  to  as a  _year  of  eligibility  service_).  The  12-month
                  period  between the date the Employee  first  completes one
                  Hour of Service  and the first  anniversary  thereof  shall
                  be  used   initially  to  determine  his   eligibility   to
                  participate  in the Plan;  thereafter,  his  eligibility to
                  participate  in the Plan shall be  determined  by reference
                  to whether he  completes  1,000 or more Hours of Service in
                  any  Plan  Year,   beginning   with  the  first  Plan  Year
                  commencing  after he first  completes  one Hour of Service.
                  An employee  who  completes  1,000 or more Hours of Service
                  in  both  the  initial  12-month  eligibility   computation
                  period  and the first Plan Year  commencing  after he first
                  completes  one Hour of Service  shall be credited  with two
                  years  of   eligibility   service  for   purposes  of  this
                  section.   Effective   as   soon   as   practicable   after
                  September 30, 1995,  the term _payroll  date_ shall replace
                  _January  1 or  July  1_ in  the  first  sentence  of  this
                  subparagraph."
            B.2  Modifications  to Section 4.1:  For purposes of  determining
the deferral  amount in the case of an Active  Participant  who is covered by
this  Article,  subsections  (a),  (d) and (e) of  Section  4.1 shall read as
follows:
                  "(a)   Deferral   Amount:   Subject   to  the   limitations
      established  by this Article IV, each active  Participant  may defer in
      any  Plan  Year  up to $60 of his  Eligible  Pay  per  pay  period,  in
      accordance  with such rules and  regulations  as may be  established by
      the Plan  Administrator.  In the  event  that a  Participant  elects to
      defer  a  portion  of his  Eligible  Pay  under  the  Plan,  it will be
      designated for  contribution  by the Employer to the Trust on behalf of
      the Participant,  and for deposit in his Salary Deferral  Account.  All
      amounts  deposited to a Participant's  Salary Deferral Account shall at
      all times be fully vested."
                  "(d)  Election  Procedures:  An election  made  pursuant to
      subsection  (b) or (c) above  shall be in the manner  specified  by the
      Plan  Administrator.  Any  election  shall  specify  the  amount of the
      deferral  desired as a whole dollar  amount,  subject to the limitation
      in subsection (a) above.  The Plan  Administrator,  in its  discretion,
      may  give  no  effect  to  an  election  that  does  not  meet  minimum
      standards for completeness and accuracy as the Plan  Administrator  may
      establish."
                  "(e)   Payroll   Deductions:    A   Participant's    Salary
      Deferral   Contributions  shall  be  withheld  from  his  Eligible  Pay
      through automatic  payroll  deductions.  Salary Deferral  Contributions
      may not be withheld  after they have been  actually  or  constructively
      received by the Participant."

      Employee  that is  outstanding  on the  Merger  Date.  If  prior to the
      Merger Date the Employee directs the Plan  Administrator  how to invest
      the   liquidation   amount   (and   the   direction   meets   the  Plan
      Administrator's  requirements),  then this amount  shall be invested in
      accordance with the Employee's  direction as soon as practicable  after
      the merger.  If no such  investment  direction is  received,  then this
      amount  shall  be  invested  in the  Security  Plus  Fund  as  soon  as
      practicable  after the merger.  Thereafter,  investment  changes may be
      made in accordance with the Plan's usual rules.

      the  D  Plan  immediately   prior  to  the  merger,   such  loan  shall
      thereafter  be subject to the  provisions  of Article VII that apply to
      already outstanding loans except as follows.
                        (1)  Section 7.3 shall not apply.

            Section  7.6 shall not  exceed  and  shall  not be  charged  more
            frequently  than  permissible  under  the  Employee's  pre-merger
            loan   agreement   and   the   related   D  Plan   terms   ("loan
            agreement").
                        (3)  Notwithstanding  Section 7.7, the interest  rate
            shall be based on the loan agreement.
                        (4)   Subject  to  Section   7.8(e),   the  term  and
            repayment  procedures  shall  be  based  on the  loan  agreement.
