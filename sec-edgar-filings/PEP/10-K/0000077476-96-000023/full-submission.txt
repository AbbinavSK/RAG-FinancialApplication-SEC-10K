                                     PART I
ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

      PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware in 1919 and was
reincorporated   in  North  Carolina  in  1986.  Unless  the  context  indicates
otherwise,  when used herein the term  "PepsiCo"  shall mean the Company and its
various  divisions  and  subsidiaries.  PepsiCo  is  engaged  in  the  following
businesses: beverages, snack foods and restaurants.

BEVERAGES

      PepsiCo's  beverage business consists of Pepsi-Cola North America ("PCNA")
and Pepsi-Cola International ("PCI").

      PCNA manufactures and sells beverage  products,  primarily soft drinks and
soft  drink  concentrates,  in the  United  States  and  Canada.  PCNA sells its
concentrates to licensed bottlers  ("Pepsi-Cola  bottlers").  Under appointments
from  PepsiCo,  bottlers  manufacture,   sell  and  distribute,  within  defined
territories,  soft  drinks  and  syrups  bearing  trademarks  owned by  PepsiCo,
including  PEPSI-COLA,  DIET PEPSI,  MOUNTAIN  DEW,  SLICE,  MUG, ALL SPORT and,
within  Canada,  7UP and DIET 7UP (the  foregoing are  sometimes  referred to as
"Pepsi-Cola  beverages").  The Pepsi/Lipton Tea Partnership,  a joint venture of
PCNA and Thomas J. Lipton Co.,  develops and sells tea concentrate to Pepsi-Cola
bottlers and develops and markets  ready-to-drink  tea products under the LIPTON
trademark.  Such products are distributed by Pepsi-Cola  bottlers throughout the
United States and Canada.  Pepsi-Cola bottlers distribute  single-serve sizes of
OCEAN  SPRAY  juice  products   throughout  the  United  States  pursuant  to  a
distribution agreement.

      Pepsi-Cola  beverages are manufactured in approximately 200 plants located
throughout the United States and Canada. PCNA operates  approximately 70 plants,
and manufactures,  sells and distributes beverages throughout  approximately 160
licensed  territories,  accounting  for  approximately  56%  of  the  Pepsi-Cola
beverages  sold in the United  States and Canada.  Approximately  130 plants are
operated by independent  licensees or joint ventures in which PCNA participates,
which  manufacture,  sell and  distribute  approximately  44% of the  Pepsi-Cola
beverages sold in the United States and Canada.  PCNA has a minority interest in
7 of these licensees, comprising approximately 70 licensed territories.

      PCI  manufactures and sells beverage  products,  primarily soft drinks and
soft drink  concentrates  outside the United  States and  Canada.  PCI sells its
concentrates to Pepsi-Cola bottlers.  Under appointments from PepsiCo,  bottlers
manufacture, sell and distribute, within defined territories,  beverages bearing
PEPSI-COLA,  7UP, MIRINDA,  DIET PEPSI,  PEPSI MAX, MOUNTAIN DEW, TEEM, DIET 7UP
and other  trademarks.  There are  approximately  590 plants  outside the United
States and Canada  bottling  PepsiCo's  beverage  products.  These  products are
available in 192 countries and territories outside the United States and Canada.
Principal international markets include Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Argentina,
Venezuela, Thailand, Spain, the United Kingdom, China and Japan.


<PAGE> 3


      PCNA and PCI make  programs  available  to  assist  licensed  bottlers  in
servicing  markets,  expanding  operations and improving  production methods and
facilities.  PCNA and PCI also offer assistance to bottlers in the distribution,
advertising  and  marketing  of  PepsiCo's  beverage  products  and offer  sales
assistance  through  special  merchandising  and  promotional  programs  and  by
training bottler  personnel.  PCNA and PCI maintain control over the composition
and quality of beverages sold under PepsiCo trademarks.

SNACK FOODS

      PepsiCo's  snack  food  business   consists  of  Frito-Lay  North  America
("Frito-Lay") and PepsiCo Foods International ("PFI").

      Frito-Lay  manufactures  and  sells a  varied  line of salty  snack  foods
throughout the United States and Canada,  including LAY'S (in the United States)
and RUFFLES brands potato chips,  DORITOS and TOSTITOS  brands  tortilla  chips,
FRITOS brand corn chips,  CHEEoTOS brand cheese flavored snacks, ROLD GOLD brand
pretzels and SUNCHIPS brand multigrain snacks.

      Frito-Lay's  products are  transported  from its  manufacturing  plants to
major  distribution  centers,  principally by  company-owned  trucks.  Frito-Lay
utilizes a "store-door-delivery" system, whereby its approximately 16,000 person
sales force delivers the snacks directly to the store shelf. This system permits
Frito-Lay to work  closely with  approximately  470,000  retail trade  customers
weekly and to be  responsive  to their needs.  Frito-Lay  believes  this form of
distribution  is a  valuable  marketing  tool and is  essential  for the  proper
distribution of products with a short shelf life.

      PFI  manufactures  and  markets  snack foods in 38  countries  outside the
United States and Canada through company-owned facilities and joint ventures. On
most of the European continent,  PepsiCo's snack food business consists of Snack
Ventures  Europe,  a joint venture between  PepsiCo and General Mills,  Inc., in
which  PepsiCo  owns a 60%  interest.  PFI also  sells a variety  of snack  food
products  which  appeal to local tastes  including,  for example  WALKERS  snack
foods, which are sold in the United Kingdom,  WEDEL sweet snacks, which are sold
in Poland and GAMESA cookies and ALEGRO (formerly  SONRICS) sweet snacks,  which
are sold in Mexico. In addition, RUFFLES, CHEEoTOS, DORITOS, FRITOS and SUNCHIPS
salty snack  foods have been  introduced  to  international  markets.  Principal
international markets include Mexico, the United Kingdom, Poland, Brazil, Spain,
France, the Netherlands, and Australia.

Franchisees  operate  approximately 1,800 additional units in the United States.
Licensees  operate  approximately  1,600 special  concept  outlets in the United
States and approximately 25 in Canada.

      KFCNA is engaged  principally in the operation,  development,  franchising
and licensing of a system of carryout and dine-in restaurants  featuring chicken

operates  approximately 2,000 restaurants in the United States and approximately
250 in Canada. Franchisees operate approximately 3,000 additional restaurants in
the  United  States  and   approximately   580  in  Canada.   Licensees  operate
approximately 110 outlets in the United States and approximately 50 in Canada.

      PRI is engaged  principally  in the  operation and  development  of casual
dining and fast-service restaurants,  delivery units and kiosks which sell PIZZA
HUT, KFC and, to a lesser extent,  TACO BELL products  outside the United States
and   Canada.   PRI   operates   approximately   925  PIZZA   HUT   restaurants,
delivery/carryout  units and kiosks,  franchisees  operate  approximately  1,350

      PepsiCo also owns, operates,  or participates as a joint venturer in other
restaurant  concepts  in the United  States.  PHNA  operates  approximately  100
D'ANGELO  SANDWICH SHOPS and  franchisees  operate  approximately  55 additional
outlets. TBNA also operates approximately 70 CHEVYS Mexican restaurants. PepsiCo
participates in a joint venture which operates approximately 80 CALIFORNIA PIZZA
KITCHEN restaurants.

      PFS, a division  of  PepsiCo,  is  engaged  in the  distribution  of food,
supplies  and  equipment  and in  providing  services  to  approximately  17,000
company-operated,   franchised  and  licensed  PIZZA  HUT,  TACO  BELL  and  KFC
restaurants in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Poland.

COMPETITION

      All of PepsiCo's  businesses are highly  competitive.  PepsiCo's beverages
and snack foods  compete in the United  States and  internationally  with widely
distributed  products of a number of major companies that have plants in many of
the areas  PepsiCo  serves,  as well as with private label soft drinks and snack
foods and with the  products  of local  and  regional  manufacturers.  PepsiCo's
restaurants  compete  in  the  United  States  and  internationally  with  other
restaurants,  restaurant chains, food outlets and home delivery operations.  PFS
competes in the United States and  internationally  with other food distribution
companies. For all of PepsiCo's industry segments, the main areas of competition
are price, quality and variety of products, and customer service.

EMPLOYEES

     At December 30, 1995,  PepsiCo  employed,  subject to seasonal  variations,
approximately   480,000  persons  (including   approximately  290,000  part-time
employees),   of  whom   approximately   358,409  (including  235,959  part-time
employees)  were employed  within the United States.  PepsiCo  believes that its
relations with employees are generally good.

RAW MATERIALS AND OTHER SUPPLIES

      The principal  materials  used by PepsiCo in its beverage,  snack food and
restaurant  businesses  are  corn  sweeteners,  sugar,  aspartame,   flavorings,
vegetable and essential oils,  potatoes,  corn,  flour,  tomato products,  pinto
beans, lettuce, cheese, butter, beef, pork and chicken products,  seasonings and
packaging materials.  Since PepsiCo relies on trucks to move and distribute many
of  its  products,  fuel  is  also  an  important  commodity.   PepsiCo  employs
specialists  to  secure  adequate  supplies  of many of these  items and has not
experienced any  significant  continuous  shortages.  Prices paid by PepsiCo for
such items are subject to fluctuation.  When prices increase, PepsiCo may or may
not pass on such increases to its customers. Generally, when PepsiCo has decided
to pass  along  price  increases,  it has  done  so  successfully.  There  is no
assurance that PepsiCo will be able to do so in the future.


<PAGE> 6


GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS

      The conduct of PepsiCo's businesses, and the production,  distribution and
use of many of its products,  are subject to various  federal laws,  such as the
Food,  Drug and  Cosmetic  Act, the  Occupational  Safety and Health Act and the
Americans  with  Disabilities  Act. The conduct of PepsiCo's  businesses is also
subject to state, local and foreign laws.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES

      PepsiCo owns numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to PepsiCo's
worldwide  businesses,  including  PEPSI-COLA,  PEPSI,  DIET  PEPSI,  PEPSI MAX,

HUT, TACO BELL,  KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN and KFC. Trademarks remain valid so long
as they are used properly for  identification  purposes,  and PepsiCo emphasizes
correct use of its  trademarks.  PepsiCo has  authorized  (through  licensing or
franchise  arrangements)  the use of many of its  trademarks in such contexts as
Pepsi-Cola  bottling  appointments,  snack food joint ventures and  wholly-owned
operations and Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC franchise  agreements.  In addition,
PepsiCo  licenses  the use of its  trademarks  on  collateral  products  for the
primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness.

      PepsiCo  either  owns or has  licenses  to use a number of  patents  which
relate to certain of its products and the processes for their  production and to
the design and operation of various equipment used in its businesses.
Some of these patents are licensed to others.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

      PepsiCo  expensed $96  million,  $152 million and $113 million on research
and development activities in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

      PepsiCo  continues to make  expenditures  in order to comply with federal,
state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations,  which expenditures
have not been  material  with respect to  PepsiCo's  capital  expenditures,  net
income or competitive position.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

      Information as to net sales, operating profits and identifiable assets for
each of PepsiCo's industry  segments,  United States restaurant chains and major
geographic areas of operations,  as well as capital  spending,  acquisitions and
investments in unconsolidated affiliates,  amortization of intangible assets and
depreciation  expense for each  industry  segment and United  States  restaurant
chain, for 1995, 1994 and 1993 is contained in Item 8 "Financial  Statements and

ITEM 7.      MANAGEMENT'S ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND
             FINANCIAL   CONDITION

MANAGEMENT'S ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION
PepsiCo's  Management's  Analysis  is  structured  in four  sections.  The first
section  provides  an overview  and  focuses on items that either  significantly
impact  comparability  of reported  financial  information or are anticipated to
significantly  impact future operating results.  The second section analyzes the
results  of  operations;  first  on a  consolidated  basis  and then for each of
PepsiCo's  three  industry  segments.   The  final  sections  address  PepsiCo's
consolidated cash flows and financial condition. Management's Analysis should be
read in conjunction with PepsiCo's audited  consolidated  financial  statements,
including Notes, on pages F-2 through F-41.

WORLDWIDE MARKETPLACE
PepsiCo's  worldwide  businesses operate in highly competitive  markets that are
subject to both global and local economic  conditions,  including the effects of
inflation,  commodity price and currency fluctuations,  governmental actions and
political  instability  and its related  dislocations.  In addition to extensive
market and product diversification, PepsiCo's operating and investing strategies
are designed,  where possible, to mitigate these factors through focused actions
on several fronts, including: (a) enhancing the appeal and value of its products
through brand promotion,  product  innovation,  quality  improvement and prudent
pricing actions;  (b) providing  excellent service to customers;  (c) increasing
worldwide  availability  of its products;  (d) acquiring  businesses and forming
alliances to increase  market presence and utilize  resources more  efficiently;
and  (e)   containing   costs  through   efficient  and  effective   purchasing,
manufacturing, distribution and administrative processes.
      In 1995,  international  businesses represented 29% of PepsiCo's net sales
and 18% of operating profit excluding the initial,  noncash charge upon adoption
of Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards No. 121 (SFAS 121),  "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of," (see Accounting Changes below).  Management believes that these percentages
will increase in the future as PepsiCo  continues to invest  internationally  to
take advantage of market  opportunities.  It is therefore  important to consider
that  movements  in  currency  exchange  rates  not  only  result  in a  related
translation  impact  on  PepsiCo's   earnings,   but  also,  and  probably  more
importantly,  can result in significant  economic  impacts that affect operating
results as well.  Changes in exchange  rates are often linked to  variability in
real growth, inflation,  interest rates, governmental actions and other factors.
In addition,  material changes  generally cause PepsiCo to adjust its financing,
investing  and  operating  strategies;  for  example,   promotions  and  product
strategies,  pricing and decisions concerning capital spending,  sourcing of raw
materials  and  packaging  (see  discussion  on  Mexico  below).  The  following
paragraphs  describe the effect of currency exchange rate movements on PepsiCo's
reported results.

<PAGE> 12


      As currency exchange rates change, translation of the income statements of
our   international   businesses  into  U.S.   dollars  affects   year-over-year
comparability of operating results.  With the exception of Mexico in 1995, sales
and operating profit growth rates for our combined international businesses were
not  materially  impacted  by the  translation  effects of  changes in  currency
exchange rates in the last three years.  Material  effects on  comparability  of
sales  and  operating   profit  arising  from   translation  are  identified  in
Management's  Analysis of operating  results.  By definition,  these translation
effects exclude the impact of businesses in highly inflationary countries, where
the accounting functional currency is the U.S.
dollar.
      Changes  in  currency  exchange  rates  also  result in  reported  foreign
exchange gains and losses, which are included as a component of selling, general
and administrative expenses.  PepsiCo reported a net foreign exchange loss of $6
million in 1995  compared to a net foreign  exchange  gain of $4 million in 1994
and a net foreign  exchange loss of $41 million in 1993.  These reported amounts
include  translation  gains and  losses  arising  from  remeasurement  into U.S.
dollars  of  the  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  of  businesses  in  highly
inflationary  countries  as well as  transaction  gains and losses.  Transaction
gains and losses arise from monetary  assets such as receivables  and short-term
interest-bearing investments as well as payables (including debt) denominated in
currencies  other than a business unit's  functional  currency.  In implementing
strategies to minimize net after-tax financing costs, the effects of anticipated
currency  exchange  rate  movements  on  debt  and  short-term  investments  are
considered together with related interest rates.
      In 1995,  Mexico  was an  extreme  example of how  movements  in  currency
exchange  rates  impact  operating   results.   In  Mexico,   PepsiCo's  largest
international market in 1994,  operations were adversely impacted by the effects
of the  approximately  50%  devaluation  of the Mexican peso which  triggered an
extremely high level of inflation.  Consumer demand shrank dramatically for most
goods  and  services  in  response  to  declining  real  incomes  and  increased
unemployment. Price increases taken to offset rising operating and product costs
further  dampened  weak  consumer  demand.  Actions taken by PepsiCo to mitigate
these adverse effects,  such as introducing  various volume building programs to
stimulate  demand and reducing  costs and capital  spending,  resulted in only a
modest decline in local currency segment  operating profit for Mexico.  However,
on a U.S.  dollar basis,  combined  segment  operating  profit and  identifiable
assets in Mexico declined dramatically,  reflecting the unfavorable  translation
effect of the much weaker peso in 1995. 

<PAGE> 13

The  following  estimated  decline  in net  income  and net income per share for
PepsiCo's  operations  in Mexico  reflected  the  decrease in Mexico's  combined
segment operating profit (see each industry segment discussion for the impact by
segment)  and  PepsiCo's  equity  share  of  the  increased  net  losses  of our
unconsolidated affiliates in Mexico:

      All amounts for Mexico  presented  above and, unless  otherwise  noted, in
Management's  Analysis  of  Industry  Segments  included  an  allocation  of the

PepsiCo's corporate expenses and financing costs.

CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY

ACCOUNTING CHANGES
PepsiCo's financial  statements reflect the noncash impact of accounting changes
adopted in 1995 and 1994.  PepsiCo early adopted SFAS 121 as of the beginning of
the fourth  quarter of 1995.  The initial,  noncash charge upon adoption of SFAS
121 was $520 million ($384 million after-tax or $0.48 per share), which included
$68 million ($49 million  after-tax or $0.06 per share)  related to  restaurants
for which closure decisions were made during the fourth quarter.  As a result of
the reduced carrying amount of certain of PepsiCo's long-lived assets to be held
and used in the business,  depreciation and amortization  expense for the 


<PAGE> 14

fourth  quarter of 1995 was reduced by $21 million  ($15  million  after-tax  or
$0.02 per share) and full-year 1996  depreciation  and  amortization  expense is
expected to be reduced by  approximately  $58 million ($39 million  after-tax or
$0.05 per  share).  As the  initial  charge was based upon  estimated  cash flow
forecasts requiring considerable management judgment,  actual results could vary
significantly from these estimates.Therefore,  future charges, though not of the
magnitude of the initial charge, are reasonably  possible although not currently
estimable.  See Note 2. See Management's Analysis - Restaurants on page 33 for a
discussion  of  other  possible   future  effects  related  to  this  change  in
accounting.
     In 1994, PepsiCoadopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112
(SFAS 112), "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment  Benefits." The cumulative
effect of adopting  SFAS 112, an $84 million  charge ($55  million  after-tax or
$0.07 per share),  principally  represented  estimated  future  severance  costs
related to services  provided  by  employees  prior to 1994.  As compared to the
previous  accounting  method,  the  ongoing  impact  of  adopting  SFAS  112 was
immaterial to 1994 operating profit. See Note 14.
      Also in 1994,  PepsiCo  adopted a  preferred  method for  calculating  the
market-related  value of plan assets  used in  determining  the  return-on-asset
component of annual pension expense and the cumulative net unrecognized  gain or
loss subject to  amortization.  The  cumulative  effect of adopting this change,
which related to years prior to 1994,  was a benefit of $38 million ($23 million
after-tax or $0.03 per share).  As compared to the previous  accounting  method,
the change reduced 1994 pension expense by $35 million ($22 million after-tax or
$0.03 per share). See Note 13.

RESTAURANT SEGMENT
In  addition  to  reporting  U.S.  and   international   results,   PepsiCo  has
historically   provided  detailed  information  and  Management's   Analysis  of
operating  results  for  each of its  three  major  restaurant  concepts  (which
included the results of other small U.S. concepts managed by Taco Bell and Pizza
Hut) on a worldwide  basis.  Beginning with the fourth quarter of 1995,  PepsiCo
has changed the  presentation  of the  restaurant  information  to more  closely
reflect  how  we  currently  manage  the  business.   Detailed  information  and
Management's  Analysis  of  operating  results  are  now  provided  for  each of
PepsiCo's  three major U.S.  concepts  (including the results of the other small
U.S.  concepts  managed  by Taco  Bell  and  Pizza  Hut)  and in  total  for the
international  operations of our restaurant concepts. Prior year amounts in Note
19 and  Management's  Analysis - Restaurants  have been restated to reflect this
change.
     As discussed in Management's Analysis - Restaurants on page 33, we began to
take  actions  in 1995 to  improve  restaurant  returns,  in  part,  by  selling
restaurants to franchisees. In addition, we have more aggressively closed stores
that do not meet our performance expectations. As a result, restaurant operating
profit  included a net gain of $51 million in 1995 from sales of  restaurants to
franchisees in excess of the costs of closing other  restaurants.  This compares
to $10 million of costs in 1994 to close stores.  Management expects these kinds
of actions to continue over the next few years as we implement our strategies to
improve restaurant returns.

OTHER FACTORS
Comparisons of 1995 to 1994 are affected by an additional week of results in the
1994 reporting  period.  Because PepsiCo's fiscal year ends on the last Saturday
in December,  a fifty-third  week is added every 5 or 6 years.  The  fifty-third
week  increased  1994 net sales by 

<PAGE> 15

an estimated  $434 million and earnings by an estimated $54 million ($35 million
after-tax or $0.04 per share).  See Items Affecting  Comparability - Fiscal Year
in Note 19 for the impact on each of PepsiCo's industry segments.
      In 1994,  PepsiCo  recorded a onetime,  noncash  gain of $18 million  ($17
million  after-tax or $0.02 per share) resulting from a public share offering by
BAESA, an unconsolidated franchised bottling affiliate in South America.
See Note 16.
      Although it will not affect  comparison  of full-year  operating  results,
international beverages' 1996 quarterly results will not be comparable to 1995's
results   because  its  1996  quarterly   reporting  will  be  changed  for  all
international  countries  except  Canada.  Due to the increase in  company-owned
bottling  operations,  in combination with the  requirements  that calendar year
results generally need to be maintained  internationally for statutory purposes,
international beverages has elected to simplify its administrative  processes by
reporting  results on a monthly basis.  Beginning in 1996, the first through the
fourth  quarters will include two, three,  three and four months,  respectively.
The  comparable  quarters in 1995 included  twelve,  twelve,  twelve and sixteen
weeks, respectively.

SIGNIFICANT  U.S.  TAX CHANGES  AFFECTING  HISTORICAL  AND FUTURE  RESULTS  
U.S. Federal income tax legislation  enacted in August 1993 included a provision
for a 1% statutory  income tax rate  increase  effective  for the full year.  As
required under Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting
for Income  Taxes," the increase in the tax rate resulted in a noncash charge of
$30 million ($0.04 per share) for the adjustment of net deferred tax liabilities
as of the beginning of 1993. The 1993  legislation  also included a provision to
reduce the tax credit associated with beverage concentrate  operations in Puerto
Rico.  In the first  year of this  change,  the tax  credit on income  earned in
Puerto Rico was limited to 60% of the amount allowed under the previous tax law,
with the limit further reduced ratably over the following four years to 40%. The
provision,  which became effective for PepsiCo's operations on December 1, 1994,
had an immaterial  impact on 1994 earnings.  The provision reduced 1995 earnings
by approximately $58 million or $0.07 per share.
      In 1994,  the U.S.  Department  of the  Treasury  proposed  a change  to a
current  regulation  (known  as Q&A 12),  which  would  further  reduce  the tax
incentives associated with beverage concentrate operations in Puerto Rico. If it
had been adopted as proposed in 1994, the change would have become effective for
PepsiCo on December 1, 1994 with an immaterial impact on 1994 earnings.  Had the
currently proposed Q&A 12 been in effect at the beginning of 1995,  earnings for
the year  would have been  reduced by an  estimated  $44  million,  or $0.05 per
share,  and the 1995  full-year  effective  tax rate  would have  increased  1.8
points.
      Assuming retroactivity to December 1, 1994 and assuming 1996 profitability
levels  comparable to 1995,  enactment of the proposed  change to Q&A 12 in 1996
would increase PepsiCo's 1996 full-year  effective tax rate by about 3.7 points.
Slightly  more than half of the  potential  increase  is due to the  retroactive
application  of the  change to Q&A 12 to years  prior to 1996  with the  balance
attributable  to  1996  earnings.   The  estimated   impacts  and  the  proposed
retroactive  effective date to December 1, 1994 are subject to change  depending
upon the  final  provisions  of Q&A 12,  if  enacted,  and the  actual  level of
profitability in 1996.
      Under generally accepted accounting principles,  the unfavorable effect of
the proposed change in Q&A 12 cannot be included in PepsiCo's effective tax rate
until it is enacted.  Due to its proposed  retroactivity,  the amount related to
the  periods  prior to its   

<PAGE> 16

enactment  date will be recognized  in full in the quarter it is enacted.  This,
along with PepsiCo's  policy to recognize  settlement of prior year audit issues
at the time they are  resolved,  may  result in  volatility  in  PepsiCo's  1996
quarterly  effective  tax rates due to the  timing of these  events,  as well as
other factors.

DERIVATIVES
PepsiCo's  policy  prohibits  the  use of  derivative  instruments  for  trading
purposes and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use.
      PepsiCo  uses  interest  rate and foreign  currency  swaps to  effectively
change the  interest  rate and  currency of  specific  debt  issuances  with the
objective of reducing  borrowing costs.  These swaps are generally  entered into
concurrently  with the  issuance of the debt they are  intended  to modify.  The
notional  amount,  interest  payment dates and maturity dates of the swaps match
the  principal,  interest  payment dates and maturity dates of the related debt.
Accordingly, any market impact (risk or opportunity) associated with these swaps
is fully offset by the opposite  market  impact on the related  debt.  PepsiCo's
credit risk  related to  interest  rate and  currency  swaps is  considered  low
because they are only entered into with strong creditworthy counterparties,  are
generally settled on a net basis and are of relatively short duration. See Notes
7, 8 and 9 for additional details regarding interest rate and currency swaps.
      In 1995,  PepsiCo  issued a seven-year  put option in connection  with the
formation  of a joint  venture  with the  principal  shareholder  of  GEMEX,  an
unconsolidated  franchised  bottling  affiliate in Mexico. The put option allows
the principal  shareholder  to sell up to 150 million GEMEX shares to PepsiCo at
66 2/3 cents per share.  PepsiCo  accounts for this put option by marking it to
market with gains or losses  recognized  currently as an adjustment to equity in
net income of unconsolidated  affiliates,  which is included in selling, general
and  administrative  expenses in the Consolidated  Statement of Income.  The put
option  liability,  which was valued at $26 million at the date of the  original
transaction,  increased  to $30 million by  year-end,  resulting in a $4 million
charge to earnings. See Notes 7, 9 and 17.
      PepsiCo  hedges  commodity  purchases  with  futures  contracts  traded on
national exchanges.  While such hedging activity has historically been done on a
limited basis,  PepsiCo could increase its hedging  activity in the future if it
believes it would result in lower total costs.  Open  contracts at year-end 1995
and 1994 and gains  and  losses  realized  in 1995 and 1994 or  deferred  at the
respective year-ends were not significant.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Included from time to time in statements by PepsiCo's  senior  executives and in
Management's   Analysis  beginning  on  page  11  are  certain   forward-looking
statements  reflecting  management's  current  expectations.  Uncertainties that
could impact those  forward-looking  statements  are  described in  Management's
Analysis  -  Worldwide  Marketplace  on page 11.  In  addition,  forward-looking
statements related to future earnings growth contemplate  double-digit  combined
segment operating profit growth and the ability,  for the next several years, to
generate  significant  gains from the sale of our  restaurants to franchisees in
excess  of costs of  closing  restaurants  and  impairment  charges,  but do not
consider  the  retroactive  impact of the  proposed  change to Q&A 12  discussed
above.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CONSOLIDATED REVIEW
To improve  comparability,  Management's  Analysis identifies the impact,  where
significant, of beverage and snack food acquisitions,  net of operations sold or
contributed to joint ventures (collectively, "net acquisitions").  The impact of
acquisitions  represents  the results of the acquired  businesses for periods in
the current  year  corresponding  to the prior year periods that did not include
the results of the  businesses.  Restaurant  units  acquired,  principally  from
franchisees,  and  constructed  units are treated the same for  purposes of this
analysis.  These units, net of units closed or sold, principally to franchisees,
are collectively referred to as "additional restaurant units."

Worldwide  net sales rose $1.9 billion or 7% in 1995.  The  fifty-third  week in
1994  reduced  the  worldwide,  U.S.  and  international  net  sales  growth  by
approximately  2 points each. The sales growth  benefited from higher  effective
net pricing,  volume gains of $934 million,  driven by worldwide snack foods and
beverages,  and $623  million due to  additional  restaurant  units.  The higher
effective net pricing reflected  increases in international  snack foods, driven
by Mexico,  and U.S.  beverages,  primarily in response to significantly  higher
prices for packaging.  These benefits were partially  offset by the  unfavorable
currency   translation  impact  of  the  devaluation  of  the  Mexican  peso  on
international snack foods. Worldwide net sales grew $3.5 billion or 14% in 1994.
The fifty-third week favorably affected worldwide,  U.S. and international sales
growth by about 2 points  each.  The  increase  reflected  volume  gains of $2.2
billion,  $934  million  due to  additional  restaurant  units and $215  million
contributed by net acquisitions. 
     International  net  sales  grew  6% in  1995  and  23%  in  1994  with  net
acquisitions  contributing  1  point  in both  years.  International  net  sales
represented  29%,  29% and 27% of  total  net  sales in  1995,  1994  and  1993,
respectively.  The  unfavorable  impact of the  devaluation  of the Mexican peso
beginning in late 1994 through 1995, and its related  effects,  slowed PepsiCo's
trend of an increasing international component of net sales.

The .7 point  increase in 1995 was  primarily  due to  worldwide  beverages  and
international  snack foods. The increase in worldwide beverages reflected higher
packaging  prices in the U.S., the effects of which were partially  mitigated by
increased  pricing,  and an unfavorable  mix shift in  international  sales from
concentrate to packaged products. The international snack foods increase was due
to the effect of  increased  costs,  primarily in Mexico,  which were  partially
mitigated  by  price  increases.  The .5 point  increase  in 1994  reflected  an
unfavorable mix shift in international  beverages,  from concentrate to packaged
products,  and in  worldwide  restaurants,  as well as lower net pricing in U.S.
beverages.  These  unfavorable  effects  were  partially  offset by a  favorable
package  and product mix shift in  international  snack foods and  manufacturing
efficiencies in U.S. snack foods.

SG&A is comprised of selling and  distribution  expenses (S&D),  advertising and
marketing  expenses (A&M), and general and  administrative  expenses (G&A) which
include gains on sales of assets as well as other income and expense.  SG&A grew
4% to $11.7  billion in 1995,  slower  than sales,  and 14% to $11.2  billion in
1994, the same rate as sales. In 1995, A&M grew at a  substantially  slower rate
than sales reflecting a slower rate of spending in worldwide  beverages and U.S.
restaurants.  G&A also grew at a substantially slower rate than sales, driven by
worldwide  beverages and U.S.  restaurants.  Worldwide  beverages benefited from
international cost containment  initiatives,  a gain on sale of an international
bottling plant,  savings in U.S. beverages from a 1994 reorganization as well as
benefits of increased pricing in U.S. beverages. U.S. restaurants benefited from
a net  gain on  sales of  restaurants  in  excess  of  costs  of  closing  other
restaurants.  S&D grew at a slightly  slower rate than sales, in part reflecting
the  benefits  of  increased  pricing  in U.S.  beverages  and a slower  rate of
spending in international snack foods.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS increased 1% to $316 million in 1995 and 3% to
$312  million in 1994.  This  noncash  expense  reduced  net income per share by
$0.30, $0.29 and $0.28 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Reported operating profit declined $214 million or 7% in 1995. Ongoing operating
profit  increased  $306  million or 10% in 1995.  The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced the operating profit growth by approximately 2 points. The profit growth
was driven by combined  segment  ongoing  operating  profit growth of 11%, which
benefited from volume growth of $283 million ($430 million  excluding the impact
of the fifty-third  week),  driven by U.S. snack foods and worldwide  beverages,
and  $76  million  due to  additional  restaurant  units.  These  advances  were
partially offset by net unfavorable currency translation impacts, primarily from
Mexico.  The benefit of higher  effective net pricing for all segments  combined
was almost entirely offset by increased  product and operating costs,  primarily
in Mexico,  and higher  packaging  prices in the U.S. The ongoing  profit margin
increased slightly to 11.5% in 1995.  Operating profit increased $294 million or
10% in 1994.  The  fifty-third  week  increased the  operating  profit growth by
approximately  2 points.  The  profit  growth  was  driven by  combined  segment
operating  profit growth of 8%, which reflected $850 million from higher volumes
($703 million excluding the impact of the fifty-third week) and $73 million from
additional restaurant units,  partially offset by higher operating expenses. The
profit   margin   decreased   almost   one-half   point   to   11.2%   in  1994.
     International  segment  ongoing  profit grew 4% in 1995, a slower rate than
sales  growth,   which  reflected  the  adverse  effects  of  the  Mexican  peso
devaluation,  particularly  in snack  foods,  partially  offset  by very  strong
restaurant  performance.  International  segment ongoing profit represented 18%,
19% and 18% of combined segment ongoing operating profit in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 1995  reported  effective  tax rate  increased  1 point to  34.0%.  The 1995
ongoing  effective  tax rate declined  slightly,  reflecting a reversal of prior
year accruals no longer  required and tax refunds,  both a result of the current
year  resolution  of certain  prior years' audit  issues.  These  benefits  were
partially  offset by a higher  foreign  effective  tax rate,  primarily due to a
provision  in the  1993  U.S.  tax  legislation  that  reduced  the  tax  credit
associated  with  beverage  concentrate  operations  in Puerto  Rico and  became
effective for PepsiCo on December 1, 1994 (see Management's Analysis Significant
U.S.  Tax Changes  Affecting  Historical  and Future  Results on page 15), and a
decrease in the  proportion  of income taxed at lower  foreign  rates.  The 1994
reported  effective tax rate declined 1 1/2 points to 33.0%.  The slight decline
in the  ongoing  effective  tax rate in 1994  reflected  a  reversal  of certain
valuation  allowances  related to  deferred  tax assets and an  increase  in the
proportion  of income  taxed at lower

foreign rates offset by the absence of a favorable adjustment in 1993 of certain

Growth in ongoing  income per share was  depressed  by estimated  dilution  from
acquisitions  of  $0.04  or 2 points  in 1995  and  $0.03  or 2 points  in 1994,
primarily due to  international  beverage  acquisitions  and  investments in new

[Note:  Unless otherwise noted,  operating profit  comparisons  within the 1995
vs.  1994  discussion  are based on  ongoing  operating  profit.  Net sales and
operating  profit  comparisons  within the  following  discussions  include the
impact of the  fifty-third  week in 1994 (see Note  19).  System  bottler  case
sales of Pepsi  Corporate  brands  (BCS) were not  impacted by the  fifty-third
week because they are measured on a calendar year basis.]

                                  1995 vs. 1994

Worldwide net sales increased $861 million or 9%. The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced the worldwide net sales growth by approximately 1 point. Comparisons are
also  affected  by the  start-up of  international  company-owned  bottling  and
distribution  operations within the past twelve months  ("start-up  operations")
and acquisitions,  principally international,  as well as the absence of certain
small  operations  sold or  contributed to joint  ventures  (collectively,  "net
acquisitions").  The start-up  operations and net  acquisitions  contributed $93
million and $56 million,  respectively,  or 2 points on a combined  basis to the
sales growth. 
     Reported worldwide  operating profit increased $92 million or 8%. Excluding
the initial  charge upon adoption of SFAS 121, which for beverages only affected
our operations in Germany,  operating  profit increased $154 million or 13%. The
fifty-third  week in 1994 reduced ongoing  worldwide  operating profit growth by
approximately 1 point.

<PAGE> 23


     Sales in the U.S.  rose $436  million or 7%. The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced the sales growth by  approximately 2 points.  The sales growth reflected
higher  pricing on most  carbonated  soft drink  (CSD)  packages,  primarily  in
response  to  significantly  higher  prices for  packaging.  Sales  growth  also
benefited from increased volume which contributed $107 million. 
     BCS consists of sales of packaged products to retailers and through vending
machines and fountain syrup by company-owned and franchised bottlers. BCS in the
U.S. increased 4%, reflecting  double-digit growth in the Mountain Dew brand and
solid  increases in Brand Pepsi.  BCS growth also benefited from increased sales
of Mug brand root beer. Total alternative beverages,  which include Lipton brand
ready-to-drink  tea,  All Sport and Ocean  Spray  Lemonade  products,  grew at a
strong  double-digit rate,  reflecting growth in Lipton brand tea and All Sport,
partially  offset by  significant  declines  in Ocean Spray  Lemonade  products,
albeit on a small base. The growth in Lipton, which represents approximately 80%
of our alternative  beverages BCS, was due to volume gains from Lipton Brisk and
fountain syrup which more than offset lower volume of the premium-priced  Lipton
Original.  Excluding  the  alternative  beverages,  BCS growth was 3%.  Packaged
products BCS grew at a faster rate than fountain syrup.
     Profit in the U.S.  increased $123 million or 12%. The fifty-third  week in
1994 reduced the operating profit growth by approximately 1 point. Profit growth
reflected the higher pricing on CSD packages and concentrate  which exceeded the
increased  product  costs,  primarily for  packaging.  Volume  gains,  driven by
packaged products, contributed $52 million ($107 million excluding the impact of
the fifty-third week) to the profit growth.  Administrative  expenses  declined,
reflecting   savings  from  a  1994  consolidation  of  headquarters  and  field
operations.  Selling and distribution expenses grew at a slower rate than sales,
in part reflecting the benefits of increased  pricing,  partially  offset by the
effects of a 6-week strike in California  that ended in August.  Advertising and
marketing  expenses  increased  modestly.  Profit  growth was aided by favorable
results from  alternative  beverages  due to higher  profit from Lipton.  Profit
growth was dampened by the absence of 1994 gains  totaling $9 million  resulting
from sales of bottling businesses. The profit margin increased nearly 1 point to
16.4%.
     In 1995,  U.S.  beverages  continued  to  execute  actions  related  to the
previously  disclosed  1992  restructuring.  Benefits  in 1995  were  offset  by
incremental costs associated with the continued  development and  implementation
of the  restructuring  actions.  The amount and  timing of  currently  projected
benefits are consistent with the revised  projections as noted below in the 1994
vs. 1993 discussion.
     International  sales  rose $425  million or 14%.  The sales  growth was not
affected by the fifty-third week in 1994.  Start-up  operations,  principally in
Eastern Europe,  and net  acquisitions,  consisting  primarily of franchised and
independent  bottling  operations  in  Asia,  contributed  $93  million  and $44
million,  respectively,  or 5 points to the sales  growth on a  combined  basis.
Sales  growth  benefited  from  volume  advances  of  $194  million,  reflecting
increased  volume  of  packaged  product  sales  and  concentrate  shipments  to
franchised  bottlers,  particularly  in markets where we are  investing  heavily
because we believe  they have high growth  potential  (Growth  Markets).  Growth
Markets primarily include Brazil,  China, Eastern Europe and India. Sales growth
was also  aided by higher  effective  net  prices on  concentrate  and  packaged
products due, in part, to product, package and country mix. Unfavorable currency
translation impacts, primarily due to a weaker Mexican peso, were 

<PAGE> 24

substantially  offset  by  favorable  currency  translation  impacts,  primarily
reflecting the strength of the Japanese yen and Western European currencies.
     International BCS grew 8%. This advance reflected broad-based growth led by
Growth Markets which, on a combined basis, grew about 50%. Each of the countries
in our Growth Markets had strong  double-digit  growth, led by near triple-digit
growth in Brazil and  strong  gains in China and India.  The  international  BCS
growth also reflected  double-digit  growth in Thailand,  Venezuela,  Turkey and
Pakistan, as well as advances in Saudi Arabia, Spain and the U.K. These advances
were  partially  offset by declines in Mexico,  our  largest  international  BCS
market, and Argentina, primarily reflecting adverse economic conditions in these
countries.
     Reported  international  profit  decreased  $31  million  or  16%.  Ongoing
operating  profit  increased  $31 million or 16%. The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced the ongoing  operating profit growth by approximately 2 points.  The net
acquisitions  and  start-up  operations  reduced  profit  by $8  million  and $3
million,  respectively, or 6 points on a combined basis. Profit growth benefited
from the higher  effective net prices on concentrate  and packaged  products and
increased volume,  primarily  concentrate,  of $52 million.  These benefits were
partially offset by net unfavorable currency  translation  impacts,  principally
due to the devaluation of the Mexican peso, and higher field operating costs and
headquarters  administrative expenses,  reflecting normal increases and costs to
support expansion.  Profit growth was aided by an $8 million gain on the sale of
a bottling plant in Greece.
     Following  is a  discussion  of  international  results  by key  geographic
market.  Ongoing profit growth  reflected a significant  net reduction in losses
from the Growth Markets, led by increased profit in Brazil and reduced losses in
India, the Czech Republic and Poland.  Profit growth was also aided by increased
volume and higher  effective net prices in Saudi Arabia and the U.K. Our largest
international  sales  markets are Canada,  Japan and Spain,  which have  sizable
company-owned   bottling  operations.   Double-digit  profit  growth  in  Canada
benefited  from cost reduction  initiatives,  while strong  double-digit  profit
growth in Japan was led by  increased  volume,  favorable  currency  translation
impacts and lower  operating  costs,  partially  offset by lower  effective  net
prices.  Profit  in Spain  was  slightly  lower,  reflecting  a higher  level of
promotional  activity which was only partially offset by increased volume. These
net gains were  partially  offset by  significantly  lower profits in Mexico and
Argentina,  primarily  reflecting  the  adverse  economic  conditions  in  those
countries.  The ongoing  operating  profit margin was  essentially  unchanged at
6.3%.
      As  discussed  on pages 12 and 13,  results in Mexico have been  adversely
impacted by economic difficulties resulting from the significant  devaluation of
the Mexican peso.  Net sales in Mexico  declined  37%,  while  operating  profit
declined $32 million or 73% to $12 million. Mexico represented  approximately 5%
and 23% of 1995  and  1994  international  beverage  segment  ongoing  operating
profit, respectively.

                                  1994 vs. 1993

Worldwide  net  sales  increased  $1.0  billion  or 12%.  The  fifty-third  week
contributed   approximately   1  point  to  the   worldwide  net  sales  growth.
International start-up operations and net acquisitions, principally in the U.S.,
contributed  $73  million  and $161  million,  respectively,  or 3  points  on a
combined basis to worldwide sales growth.
      Worldwide  operating profit increased $108 million or 10%. The fifty-third
week  enhanced  the  profit  growth by  approximately  2  points.  International
start-up  operations 

<PAGE> 25


reduced operating profit by $19 million or 2 points,  while net acquisitions had
no impact on profit  growth.  
     Sales in the U.S rose $623 million or 11%. The  fifty-third  week aided the
sales  growth by  approximately  2 points.  Net  acquisitions  contributed  $158
million or 3 points to sales  growth.  Volume growth  contributed  $510 million,
driven by CSD packaged products. This benefit,  combined with a mix shift to the
higher-priced  alternative beverage packaged products and higher concentrate and
fountain syrup pricing,  was partially  offset by lower net pricing to retailers
and a mix shift to The Cube,  our  value-priced  24-pack.  The lower net pricing
reflected  increased  price  discounts and  promotional  allowances  for CSD, in
response to private  label  competition,  and Lipton  brand tea.  See Note 1 for
discussion concerning classification of promotional price allowances.
      BCS in the U.S. increased 6%, reflecting strong double-digit growth in the
Mountain Dew brand and solid gains in Brand Pepsi.  BCS growth also benefited by
strong  double-digit  growth  in Lipton  brand  tea and gains in the Diet  Pepsi
brand. These advances,  combined with the national distribution of All Sport and
Ocean  Spray  Lemonade  in 1994 and gains in the Slice  brands,  were  partially
offset  by  significant  declines  in  the  Crystal  Pepsi  brands.  Alternative
beverages  contributed 2 points to the BCS growth. BCS of fountain syrup grew at
a slower rate than packaged products.
      Profit in the U.S.  increased  $85  million  or 9%. The  fifty-third  week
enhanced the profit growth by  approximately  1 point.  Volume gains,  driven by
packaged  products,  contributed $305 million ($250 million excluding the impact
of the  fifty-third  week) to profit  growth.  This  benefit,  combined with the
higher  concentrate and fountain syrup pricing,  was partially  offset by higher
operating  expenses,  the lower net pricing to  retailers,  the mix shift to The
Cube and increased  product costs.  Selling and distribution  expenses grew at a
faster rate than sales, driven by higher volume-driven labor costs.  Advertising
and marketing  costs grew at a slower rate than sales.  Administrative  expenses
declined modestly,  reflecting savings from a 1994 consolidation of headquarters
and field  operations  and a  reduction  in the scope of the 1992  restructuring
actions,  both  discussed  below.  These  benefits were largely offset by normal
increases in administrative  expenses. The increased product costs reflected the
mix shift to the higher cost alternative beverages and higher ingredient prices,
partially offset by lower packaging  prices.  Alternative  beverages,  driven by
Lipton brand tea, aided the profit growth.  The profit margin declined  slightly
to 15.6%.
      In the third  quarter of 1994,  U.S.  beverages  reversed  into income $24
million of a $115 million  restructuring accrual established in 1992 and, in the
third and fourth  quarters,  recorded  additional  charges totaling $22 million,
primarily reflecting  management's decision to further consolidate  headquarters
and field  operations.  The 1994 charges cover severance  costs  associated with
employee  terminations and relocation costs for employees who, in 1994, accepted
offers to relocate.  The 1992 charge arose from an organizational  restructuring
designed to improve  customer  focus by  realigning  resources  consistent  with
Pepsi-Cola's "Right Side Up" operating philosophy,  as well as a redesign of key
administrative and business processes.  The charge included provisions for costs
associated  with  redeployed  and  displaced  employees,  the  redesign  of core
processes and office closures.
      The $24  million  reversal  reflects  both  refinements  of the  estimates
originally used to establish the accrual,  principally for costs associated with
displaced  employees,  and  management's  decision  to  reduce  the scope of the
restructuring.  The  organizational  restructuring  was  completed in 1992.  The
nationwide  implementation  of several  of the  

<PAGE> 26

anticipated  administrative  and business process  redesigns has been completed,
with the balance of the redesigns  projected to be completed over the next three
years.
      The benefits of the restructuring activities, when fully implemented, were
originally projected to be approximately $105 million annually, based on reduced
employee and facility  costs.  The current  projection  of annual  benefits from
these sources has decreased to approximately  $40 million  reflecting,  in part,
the reduced scope of the restructuring. While difficult to measure, in 1994 U.S.
beverages  estimated  other  sources  of  benefits  from  the  restructuring  of
approximately  $90  million  annually,  based on  centralization  of  purchasing
activities   and   incremental   volume  and  pricing   from   improvements   in
administrative  and business  processes.  These additional  sources of benefits,
although  identified when the 1992 restructuring  accrual was established,  were
not included in the projected  annual benefits due to significant  uncertainties
and  difficulties in quantifying the amounts,  if any, of such benefits.  Due to
delays in implementing  some of the restructuring  actions,  full realization of
the expected  benefits  also has been  delayed.  Benefits in 1994 were offset by
incremental costs associated with the continued  development and  implementation
of the restructuring actions. This offset is expected to continue into 1995. Net
benefits  are  expected  to begin in 1996 and to increase  annually  until fully
realized in 1998. All benefits  derived from the  restructuring  actions will be
reinvested in the business to strengthen our competitive position.
      International  sales  rose  $426  million  or 16%.  The  fifty-third  week
enhanced the sales growth by approximately 1 point. This growth reflected higher
volume of $300 million, the start-up of company-owned  bottling and distribution
operations,  principally  in  Eastern  Europe,  and the  first  year of sales of
Stolichnaya   vodka  under  the  1994  appointment  of  an  affiliate  of  Grand
Metropolitan as the exclusive U.S. and Canadian distributor.  Higher concentrate
pricing was offset by an unfavorable  currency  translation impact and lower net
pricing on  packaged  products.  The  unfavorable  currency  translation  impact
reflected a weaker Canadian dollar,  Spanish peseta and Mexican peso,  partially
offset by a stronger Japanese yen.
      International  case sales  increased 9%,  reflecting  strong  double-digit
growth in Asia, led by China and India, and solid advances in Latin America,  as
growth in Mexico  more than  offset  declines in  Venezuela.  Latin  America and
Mexico represent our largest international BCS region and country, respectively.
Double-digit  advances  in Eastern  Europe and the Middle  East,  combined  with
single-digit  growth in Western  Europe and  Canada,  were  partially  offset by
declines in Africa. Pepsi Max, a new low-calorie cola, aided BCS growth.
      International  profit  increased $23 million or 13%. The fifty-third  week
enhanced the profit growth by approximately 2 points.  Net acquisitions  reduced
profit by $9 million or 5 points.  The increased  profit reflected volume growth
of $75 million,  led by  concentrate  shipments.  This benefit,  combined with a
decline in advertising  and marketing  expenses not attributed to volume growth,
was  partially  offset  by  increased  field  and  headquarters   administrative
expenses,  start-up  losses,  principally in Eastern Europe,  and an unfavorable
currency  translation  impact,  primarily from the Mexican peso and the Canadian
dollar.  The  increased  administrative  expenses  reflected  costs  to  support
expansion in Growth Markets. The higher concentrate pricing was partially offset
by a decline in finished  product sales to franchised  bottlers,  principally in
Japan, and the lower net pricing on packaged products. Increased profit from the
first year of sales of Stolichnaya,  under the 1994  appointment of an affiliate
of Grand  Metropolitan  as the exclusive  U.S. and Canadian  distributor,  aided
profit  growth.  The new Pepsi Max product  significantly  

<PAGE> 27

contributed to profit growth.  Profit increased in Latin America, led by Mexico,
and in Western  Europe,  reflecting  significantly  reduced  losses in  Germany.
Profit also grew in Asia,  reflecting  advances in Japan.  The profit growth was
restrained  by  start-up  losses in  Eastern  Europe  and  declines  in  Canada,
reflecting  private label  competition.  The profit margin  remained  relatively
unchanged at 6.2%.
     The  1992   restructuring   actions  to  streamline  the  acquired  Spanish
franchised  bottling  operation  were  substantially  completed  in 1994.  These
actions have resulted in total savings  approximating  $15 million in 1994, with
total annual savings  expected to grow to about $20 million in 1995,  consistent
with our original  projection.  These  savings will continue to be reinvested in
our businesses to strengthen our competitive position.
      The  significant  devaluation  of the Mexican  peso in late 1994 and early
1995 did not materially  impact 1994  international  beverage  operating profit.
However, because Mexico, our largest profit country,  represented  approximately
23% of international  beverage operating profit in 1994, the devaluation and its
related  effects were expected to have an  unfavorable  impact on 1995 operating
profit.  The operations in Mexico had begun to take actions to increase  volume,
enhance net pricing and reduce costs,  including evaluating alternative sourcing
of raw materials. Nonetheless, significant uncertainties remained in Mexico and,
as a result, it was not possible to quantify the impact. International beverages
had also  begun to take  actions  in  several  other  countries  in 1995 to help
mitigate the impact.

[Note:  Net  sales  and  operating  profit  comparisons  within  the  following
discussions  include the impact of the fifty-third  week in 1994 (see Note 19),
while pound and kilo growth have been adjusted to exclude its impact.]

                                  1995 vs. 1994

Worldwide  net  sales  rose  $281  million  or 3%.  Worldwide  operating  profit
increased $55 million or 4%. The fifty-third week in 1994 reduced both worldwide
net sales and operating profit growth by approximately 2 points. 
     Sales in the U.S.  grew $484 million or 10%. The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced the sales growth by approximately 2 points. The sales increase reflected
volume growth of $411 million and increased pricing across all major brands. The
volume growth reflected gains in almost all major brands, led by our low-fat and
no-fat snacks, which accounted for

<PAGE> 28

over 45% of the total sales growth. Volume growth was further aided by increased
promotional price allowances and merchandising programs to retailers,  which are
reported as marketing  expenses and therefore do not reduce reported sales.  See
Note  1  for  further  discussion   concerning   classification  of  promotional
allowances.
     Pound volume in the U.S. advanced 11%, reflecting  exceptional  performance
from the low-fat and no-fat categories. These categories contributed over 45% of
the total pound growth, driven by Rold Gold brand pretzels, Baked Tostitos brand
tortilla  chips,  Tostitos  brand salsa and Ruffles  Light and Baked Lay's brand
potato chips.  Doritos brand tortilla chips, driven by new flavor extensions and
packaging,  had solid  single-digit  pound growth.  Lay's brand potato chips and
other Ruffles  brand  products grew  single-digits,  benefiting  from new flavor
extensions  like Hidden  Valley Ranch Wavy Lay's brand potato  chips,  Lay's and
Ruffles KC Masterpiece Barbecue Flavor brand potato chips, French Onion Flavored
Ruffles and Lay's Salsa & Cheese  Flavored  brand potato chips.  Chee.tos  brand
cheese flavored snacks, fueled by fried Chee.tos, had single-digit growth, while
Fritos brand corn chips declined slightly reflecting lower promotional spending.
     Profit in the U.S. grew $107 million or 10%. The  fifty-third  week in 1994
reduced  the profit  growth by  approximately  3 points.  The low-fat and no-fat
categories  contributed  about 40% of the total profit growth.  The total profit
increase  reflected strong volume growth,  which  contributed $193 million ($244
million  excluding the impact of the  fifty-third  week) and higher pricing that
exceeded increased promotional price allowances and merchandising  support. This
growth was partially offset by increased  operating costs,  which were driven by
higher  selling,   distribution  and   administrative   expenses  and  increased
investment in brand  marketing to support and maintain  strong volume  momentum.
The higher  administrative  expenses reflected  investment  spending to maintain
volume  growth and a competitive  advantage,  including  new  manufacturing  and
delivery  systems,  feasibility  studies related to a joint venture  arrangement
with  Sara Lee  Bakery  and a  reorganization  of field  operations  to  improve
customer  service.  The profit growth was also hampered by higher  manufacturing
costs, reflecting increased capacity costs and an unfavorable sales mix shift to
lower-margin value-oriented packages. Increased carton and packaging prices were
partially  offset by  favorable  potato and oil prices.  Although  difficult  to
forecast,  1996  potato and oil prices are  expected  to remain  about even with
1995, while prices of corn and potato flakes,  used in Baked Lay's, are expected
to increase.  However, due to extreme weather conditions in recent years, potato
prices  have been less  predictable.  Carton  and  packaging  prices in 1996 are
expected to remain even with 1995. The profit margin  remained about the same at
20.6%.
     As discussed on pages 12 and 13, 1995 results in Mexico have been adversely
impacted by economic difficulties resulting from the significant  devaluation of
the Mexican peso. This effect was particularly  dramatic on international  snack
food results as Mexico represented approximately 64% of international snack food
1994 operating profit. Net sales in Mexico declined 39% in 1995, while operating
profit  declined  $120  million  or 53% to $106  million.  As a  result,  Mexico
represented only 35% of 1995 international  snack food profit.  Since the change
in results of Mexico had such a distortive  effect on  international  snack food
results,  net sales and operating  profit  discussions  that follow  exclude the
effects of Mexico where noted.  However,  Sabritas and Gamesa, our operations in
Mexico, are discussed separately below.
     International  sales decreased $203 million or 6%. Sweet snacks  (primarily
candy and cookies)  accounted for approximately 25% of international  snack food
sales in 1995,  

<PAGE> 29


compared to 30% in 1994.  Excluding Mexico,  international  sales grew more than
25%; the  fifty-third  week in 1994 reduced the sales growth by  approximately 2
points. This growth reflected  increased volumes of $288 million,  led by Brazil
and the U.K.  The sales  growth also  benefited  from a  favorable  mix shift to
higher-priced  packages and products and  acquisitions,  which  contributed  $43
million.
     International kilo growth is reported on a systemwide basis, which includes
both consolidated businesses and joint ventures operating for at least one year.
Salty snack  kilos rose 9%,  reflecting  strong  double-digit  volume  growth in
Brazil,  due to a more  stable  economy;  the U.K.,  the  Netherlands  and Spain
achieved  double-digit  growth  fueled,  in part,  by in-bag  promotions.  These
advances were partially offset by double-digit declines at Sabritas. Sweet snack
kilos grew 12%,  reflecting  double-digit  advances at Gamesa and in France, and
single-digit  advances at the Alegro sweet snack division  (formerly Sonrics) of
Sabritas. 
     International   operating   profit   decreased  $52  million  or  15%.  The
fifty-third  week in 1994 reduced the operating profit growth by approximately 1
point. Excluding Mexico, international operating profit increased $68 million or
54%; the fifty-third  week in 1994 reduced the profit growth by  approximately 1
point.  This growth reflected the favorable mix shift to higher-priced  packages
and products and increased  volumes of $48 million,  partially  offset by higher
operating costs and increased  administrative  expenses. The increased operating
costs  reflected  increased  manufacturing  costs  due to higher  commodity  and
packaging  prices.  The increased  administrative  costs  reflected  broad-based
investment spending on regional business  development  initiatives and increased
headquarters expenses.  Including Mexico, the profit margin decreased 1 point to
9.8%.
      The following  discussions of  profitability  by key business  exclude any
allocation for division or corporate overhead.
      Operating profit declined over 50% at Sabritas,  reflecting an increase in
operating costs, an unfavorable  currency  translation impact and lower volumes,
partially  offset by higher  pricing.  The increased  operating  costs reflected
significantly  higher  manufacturing  costs due to higher  ingredient prices and
wage rates, as well as increased selling and distribution expenses. Lower-margin
sweet snack kilo volume from the Alegro division increased 7% despite lapping of
a successful 1994 promotion. Although Sabritas maintained its high market share,
higher-margin  salty snack kilos  declined  almost 20% due, in part,  to reduced
demand,  higher pricing and lapping strong volume gains in 1994 as a result of a
successful in-bag promotion.
      Gamesa's profit more than doubled, on a small base, despite the effects of
the economic difficulties resulting from the devaluation of the Mexican peso, as
higher pricing and increased  volumes more than offset higher  operating  costs,
the unfavorable currency translation impact and higher administrative costs. The
increased operating costs primarily reflected higher  manufacturing costs due to
higher  ingredient  prices and wage rates,  increased  selling and  distribution
expenses, and higher advertising expenses. Sweet snack kilos grew 15%, driven by
route expansion and successful promotions.
     Walkers' profit grew 37%, driven by increased  volume  reflecting  gains in
the  Walkers  crisps  brand as a result of  successful  in-bag  promotions,  and
Doritos brand tortilla chips.  Higher  manufacturing  costs,  reflecting  higher
potato and  packaging  prices,  were more than offset by  favorable  selling and
distribution,  administrative and advertising and marketing expenses.  Increased
sales of Doritos, introduced late in the second quarter of

<PAGE> 30

1994,  represented  approximately  25% of the  strong  kilo  growth  in the U.K.
Doritos generated a slight profit compared to a loss last year.
      Brazil's profit more than doubled,  on a small base, as increased  volumes
of core brands,  reduced selling and  distribution  expenses and a favorable mix
shift to higher-priced  packages were partially  offset by higher  manufacturing
costs,  primarily  potato  prices.  Brazil is operating at maximum  capacity and
therefore, investments are currently being made to expand production capacity to
meet the strong consumer demand,  due in part to the substantial  improvement in
the country's  economy.  These investments are expected to be completed early in
the second quarter of 1996.

                                  1994 vs. 1993

Worldwide net sales rose $1.2 billion or 18%. The fifty-third  week  contributed
approximately  2 points to the worldwide net sales growth.  Worldwide  operating
profits  increased  $187 million or 16%. The worldwide  operating  profit growth
benefited from the fifty-third week by approximately 2 points.
      Sales  in the  U.S.  grew  $646  million  or  15%.  The  fifty-third  week
contributed about 2 points to the sales growth.  The increase in sales reflected
volume  growth of $660  million.  Volume  gains  reflected  growth in most major
brands and line extensions of existing products.  Sales growth was further aided
by increased  promotional price allowances and marketing  programs to retailers,
which are reported as marketing  expenses and  therefore do not reduce  reported
sales.  Higher  gross  pricing  was  offset  by a sales  mix  shift  to  larger,
value-oriented packages and products with lower gross prices.
      Total U.S. pound volume  advanced 13%. This  performance was led by strong
double-digit  growth in Lay's brand  potato  chips,  reflecting  the  successful
promotion of Wavy Lay's brand  potato  chips and growth of Lay's KC  Masterpiece
Barbecue Flavor brand potato chips, Rold Gold and Rold Gold Fat Free Thins brand
pretzels and Tostitos brand tortilla chips,  driven by Restaurant Style Tostitos
brand and the expanded  distribution  of Baked  Tostitos  brand.  Doritos  brand
tortilla  chips had solid  single-digit  volume  growth  while Fritos brand corn
chips and Chee.tos  brand cheese  flavored  snacks  reflected  low  double-digit
growth. Ruffles brand potato chips showed modest growth.
      Profit  in the  U.S.  grew  $124  million  or 14%.  The  fifty-third  week
contributed  about 3 points to the profit  growth.  This  performance  reflected
strong volume growth, which contributed $340 million ($289 million excluding the
impact of the fifty-third  week). This growth was partially offset by the impact
of increased  operating and  manufacturing  costs and an  unfavorable  sales mix
shift to  lower-margin  packages and products.  Increased  operating  costs were
driven by higher  selling,  distribution  and new system  costs in  addition  to
increased  investment in marketing  costs to maintain  strong  momentum in 1995.
Increased  capacity costs were partially offset by  manufacturing  efficiencies.
Higher  vegetable oil prices were  substantially  offset by lower  packaging and
potato prices.  Increased promotional price allowances and merchandising support
largely  offset higher  pricing on certain  brands.  The profit margin  remained
relatively unchanged at 20.5%.
      Though  difficult to forecast,  there were no material changes expected in
potato costs for 1995.  However,  potato  prices have been less  predictable  in
recent years due to weather  conditions.  Vegetable  oil prices were expected to
decline  slightly  from the high 1994 levels,  while the cost of  packaging  was
expected to increase.

<PAGE> 31

      International  sales  rose  $591  million  or 22%.  The  fifty-third  week
contributed  approximately 1 point to the sales growth.  Sweet snacks (primarily
candy and cookies)  accounted for approximately 30% of international  snack food
sales in both 1994 and 1993. Acquisitions contributed $67 million or 2 points to
sales growth. The balance of the sales growth was driven by higher volume, which
contributed  $590 million,  led by successful  promotions by the Sabritas  salty
snack and  sweet  snack  business  in  Mexico.  A  favorable  brand mix shift to
higher-priced  products,  primarily  in Latin  America and the U.K.,  and higher
pricing were largely offset by the unfavorable  currency translation impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar, principally against the Mexican peso.
      International  systemwide  salty  snack  kilos  rose  16%,  led by  strong
double-digit growth at Sabritas, in Spain and Brazil and solid gains in the U.K.
Systemwide sweet snack kilos also grew 16%, reflecting  double-digit advances at
Gamesa and Sabritas and gains in Egypt and Poland.
     International  profit  increased $63 million or 22%. The  fifty-third  week
contributed  about 1 point to the profit growth.  Higher volume  contributed $95
million  ($87  million   excluding  the  impact  of  the  fifty-third  week)  to
international  profit  growth,  led by  Sabritas.  The  combined  impact  of the
favorable  product  and  package mix  shifts,  primarily  in the U.K.  and Latin
America,  and modestly higher pricing were more than offset by higher direct and
administrative  costs and an unfavorable  currency  translation  impact from the
Mexican peso. Higher direct costs resulted primarily from investment initiatives
to build brand equity and enhance distribution channels in Mexico. Profit growth
was also  dampened by the lapping  oflast  year's  noncash  credit of $6 million
resulting  from the  decision  to retain a small  snack chip  business  in Japan
previously  held for sale. The profit margin  remained  relatively  unchanged at
10.8%.
      The  international  restructuring  charge  in 1992  related  primarily  to
actions to consolidate and streamline the Walkers business in the U.K. that were
substantially  completed  during 1994. These actions were estimated to result in
annual  savings of about $32 million,  which  continue to be  reinvested  in the
business to strengthen our competitive position.
      Following  is a  discussion  of  the  results  of  our  key  international
businesses.
      Strong  double-digit  profit growth at Sabritas was driven by higher salty
and sweet snack  volumes.  This benefit,  combined with a favorable  product mix
shift  to   higher-margin   snacks   and  lower   manufacturing   overhead   and
administrative   costs,   more  than  offset  increased  potato  costs,   higher
promotional spending and an unfavorable currency translation impact.
      Walkers'  profit  advanced  at a strong  double-digit  rate,  driven  by a
favorable product mix shift reflecting increased sales of higher-margin  branded
products  and the  elimination  of most  lower-margin  private  label  products,
increased   volumes,   lower  raw  material  and   packaging   costs  and  lower
manufacturing  expenses  resulting from the 1992  restructuring  actions.  These
benefits  offset  start-up costs related to the launch of Doritos brand tortilla
chips which exceeded incremental profit generated.
      Gamesa posted strong profit growth on a relatively small base,  reflecting
a favorable package mix shift to higher-margin  single-serve  products and lower
manufacturing  overhead and  administrative  costs resulting from cost reduction
initiatives.  These  benefits were  partially  offset by higher  product  costs,
selling  and  distribution  costs  associated  with  the  expansion  of a direct
delivery system and an unfavorable currency translation impact.

      The  significant  devaluation  of the Mexican  peso in late 1994 and early
1995 did not materially impact 1994  international  snack food operating profit.
However,  because Sabritas and Gamesa combined represented  approximately 64% of
international  snack food  operating  profit in 1994,  the  devaluation  and its
related  effects were expected to have an  unfavorable  impact on 1995 operating
profit.  Sabritas  and Gamesa had begun to increase  pricing  and reduce  costs,
including  evaluating  alternative  sourcing  of  raw  materials.   Nonetheless,
significant  uncertainties  remained  in Mexico  and,  as a  result,  it was not
possible to quantify  the  impact.  International  snack foods had also begun to
take  actions in several of its other  countries  in 1995 to help  mitigate  the
impact.

                                  1995 vs. 1994

Worldwide net sales  increased  $807 million or 8%. Sales in the U.S.  increased
$508 million or 6%, while international sales increased $299 million or 16%. The
fifty-third week in 1994 reduced the worldwide, U.S. and international net sales
growth by approximately 2 points each. 
     Reported  worldwide  operating profit declined $300 million or 41%. Ongoing
worldwide  operating  profit  increased $137 million or 19%; U.S.  increased $94
million or 14% and  international  increased $43 million or 61%. The fifty-third
week  in  1994  reduced  the  ongoing  worldwide   operating  profit  growth  by
approximately 4 points.  U.S. and international  profit growth were reduced by 4
and 7 points, respectively.
     As discussed  in Notes 2 and 19,  PepsiCo  recorded  the  initial,  noncash
charge upon  adoption  of SFAS 121 in 1995,  which had a  significant  effect on
restaurant results. Historically,  PepsiCo had evaluated and measured impairment
on a total  division  basis.  As a result  of  adopting  SFAS 121,  PepsiCo  now
evaluates each individual  restaurant for impairment.  This change resulted in a
charge  of $437  million  to  reduce  the  carrying  amount  of  1,247 or 10% of
PepsiCo's company-operated  restaurants. The charge represented approximately 7%
of the total  carrying  amount of  restaurant  long-lived  assets.  The  reduced
carrying amount of restaurant assets is expected to reduce 1996 depreciation and
amortization  expense by approximately  $45 million.  Also,  because PepsiCo now
evaluates each  restaurant for  impairment,  future  charges,  though not of the
magnitude  of the initial  charge  recorded  in 1995,  are  reasonably  possible
although  not  currently  estimable.  These  charges  will  generally  arise  as
estimates used in the evaluation and  measurement of impairment upon adoption of
SFAS 121 are refined based upon new  information or as a result of future events
or changes in circumstances  that cause other restaurants to be impaired.  Also,
any future  expenditures  for impaired stores that would normally be capitalized
will have to be immediately evaluated for recoverability.  The initial impact of
adopting  SFAS 121,  as well as its  ongoing  application,  will also  generally
result in lower closure costs or increased gains for impaired  restaurants  that
are closed or sold, respectively.
     As disclosed  in our 1994 Annual  Report and updated in our 1995 reports on
Form 10-Q, we have  evaluated and begun to execute  actions in 1995 in an effort
to improve  total  restaurant  operating  results and returns on our  restaurant
investments.  Our overall strategy is to leverage the collective strength of our
three restaurant concepts by strengthening our brand leadership,  leveraging our
business   systems  and  restaurant   development   activities,   and  achieving
operational excellence.
     Brand  leadership  contemplates,  in  part,  the need to be  innovative  by
providing  new  products  and  programs  to  respond  to  consumer  needs  while
maintaining a value  orientation.  This year,  for example,  we have  introduced
several new products such as Pizza Hut's Stuffed Crust Pizza and Buffalo  Wings,
KFC's Tumble  Marinated  Original  Recipe product  Colonel's,  Crispy Strips and
Chunky  Chicken Pot Pies and Taco Bell's Double Decker Taco,  Texas Taco and new
line of Sizzlin' Bacon products.  In addition, we have also offered new programs
to  respond  to  consumer  needs  such as  "You'd  Be Crazy to Cook"  promotion,
delivery  service  and the Mega Meal value  offering  at KFC and  Extreme  Value
Meals,  Kids' meals and the low-fat  Border Lights menu at Taco Bell. We believe
our  ability  to develop  and bring to market  new  products  that  attract  and
maintain our customer base is an important factor for continued profit growth in
the restaurant segment.

<PAGE> 34

With respect to leveraging our business systems,  consolidation of international
headquarters  administration  of our three  concepts was completed this year and
consolidation of international regional and country administration is well under
way. The consolidation of administrative operations in the U.S., such as payroll
and accounts  payable,  has begun and is expected to be completed  over the next
few years. Also, consolidation of restaurant procurement on a worldwide basis is
substantially completed with significant annual savings anticipated beginning in
1996. As we move forward,  our concepts will share  restaurant  facilities where
appropriate.  For example,  early  indications are that our combined Taco Bell -
KFC units in the U.S.  are  performing  well,  as the Taco Bell  lunch  business
complements the strong KFC dinner business.  In fact, the current plan calls for
us to approximately triple the current number of combined U.S. units to over 300
units during 1996.
     In  addition,  we plan to  continue  to  selectively  use  franchisees  and
licensees in certain  markets where their  expertise can be leveraged to improve
the overall operational excellence of our concepts systemwide. In 1995, we began
to refranchise  (sell  company-operated  restaurants to franchisees) and license
company-operated restaurants and more aggressively close stores that do not meet
our  performance  expectations.   These  unit-related  actions  aided  worldwide
restaurant operating profit growth by $61 million,  reflecting a net gain of $51
million in 1995 ($88  million of  refranchising  gains  offset by $37 million of
costs of closing other  restaurants) as compared to $10 million of store closure
costs in 1994.  Included in the $37 million are costs associated with 185 stores
scheduled to be closed in 1996.  Operating  profit in 1996 is not expected to be
significantly  affected  by the  estimated  net impact of the absence of profits
attributed to those units sold in 1995 and those units currently  anticipated to
be sold in 1996 compared to the additional franchise royalty revenues related to
those units and the losses avoided for restaurants  closed in 1995 and scheduled
to be closed in 1996.  Though  difficult to forecast,  management  anticipates a
favorable  impact from these  kinds of  unit-related  actions  over the next few
years as we continue the  implementation of our strategies to improve restaurant
returns. 
     We expect that total system units will,  on average,  continue to expand at
1995's annual rate of  approximately  6%, though only about 1% of the net growth
will be company-operated. As a result, although our overall ownership percentage
of total  system  units  declined by about 2 1/2 points in 1995,  we continue to
anticipate  that our  percentage  ownership  will  decline  on average by 1 to 2
points annually over the next 3 to 5 years, driven by declines in the U.S.

[Note: A summary of the 1995 restaurant unit activity for each U.S.  concept and
for  international  restaurant  operations  is included in each of the following
discussions.]  

     Restaurants generated cash flows of nearly $600 million in 1995 compared to
marginally positive cash flows in 1994. This primarily reflected reduced capital
spending and  acquisitions  of $322 million and $78 million,  respectively,  and
proceeds of $165 million from our refranchising  efforts.  We currently estimate
that our level of capital  spending in 1996 will  approximate  the $750  million
invested  in  1995;  however,  we  expect  more of the  spending  to be used for
refurbishing our existing restaurants and less on new store development.
     With  respect to  operational  excellence,  we have made  investments  in a
number of initiatives  during the past year targeted at  consistently  providing
our customers with high quality products, courteous and timely service and clean
and  attractive  restaurants.   We  believe  this  is  an  important  factor  in
maintaining  our current  customer base as well as attracting new customers.  We
have implemented customer satisfaction measures to evaluate the success of these
initiatives.

                                  1994 vs. 1993

Worldwide  net  sales  increased  $1.2  billion  or 12%.  The  fifty-third  week
contributed   approximately  1  point  to  the  sales  growth,   with  U.S.  and
international operations benefiting by about 1 point and 2 points, respectively.
Sales in the U.S. increased $668 million or 8% and international sales rose $497
million or 37%.
     Worldwide operating profit declined $48 million or 6%. The fifty-third week
mitigated  the  profit  decline  by  approximately  3  points,   with  U.S.  and
international  operations  benefiting  at the  same  rate.  Profit  in the  U.S.
declined  $26  million or 4% and  international  profit fell $22 million or 24%,
which included a $7 million charge to consolidate the U.S.  headquarters for the
three international restaurant concepts into one.
     The significant devaluation of the Mexican peso in late 1994 and early 1995
did not  materially  impact  1994  international  restaurant  operating  profit.
Results  from  Mexico   constituted  an  immaterial   portion  of  international
restaurant  profit.  However,  the  devaluation  and its  related  effects  were
expected to have an unfavorable impact on 1995 results. The operations in Mexico
had  begun  increasing   pricing  and  reducing  costs,   including   evaluating
alternative  sourcing  of raw  materials.  In  addition,  further  expansion  of
company-operated  units was  temporarily  halted  pending  stabilization  of the
economy.  Nonetheless,  significant  uncertainties  remained in Mexico and, as a
result, it was not possible to quantify the impact.
     Late  in  1994,  Roger  Enrico  was  named  Chairman,   PepsiCo   Worldwide
Restaurants.  He began to evaluate  several  options to improve their  operating
results and  returns on our total  restaurant  investments.  Examples of options
considered to improve  investment  returns  included a reduced  company share of
future new restaurant  development and sale of some existing company restaurants
to  franchisees.  The cash  generated  from these  options  would most likely be
reinvested in our nonrestaurant businesses or used to repurchase PepsiCo capital
stock.  We expected to begin making  decisions on these and other options during
1995 as we continued to refine our restaurant operating strategies.

                                  1995 vs. 1994

Net sales increased $265 million or 7%. The fifty-third week in 1994 reduced the
sales growth by approximately 2 points.  The sales growth reflected $148 million
from  additional  units  (units  constructed  and  acquired,   principally  from
franchisees, net of units closed or sold, principally to franchisees) and growth
in same store sales for  company-operated  units of 4%. The improved  same store
sales performance was driven by Stuffed Crust Pizza, introduced nationally early
in the second quarter, and reflected strong growth in carryout and

<PAGE> 38

delivery,  and modest growth in dine-in.  Same store sales  increases  were also
fueled by a higher average guest check resulting from less  promotional  pricing
than in 1994 and the early 1995 national introduction of Buffalo Wings.
     Reported  operating profit grew $23 million or 8%. Ongoing operating profit
increased $91 million or 32%, in part,  reflecting a weak profit  performance in
1994  combined with the  exceptional  performance  of Stuffed  Crust Pizza.  The
fifty-third  week in 1994 reduced the profit growth by  approximately  3 points.
The profit growth reflected additional units that contributed $31 million, a net
gain of $24 million in 1995 ($42  million of  refranchising  gains offset by $18
million of costs of closing  other  restaurants)  as  compared  to $4 million of
store closure costs in 1994, lower store operating costs and increased franchise
royalty revenues.  The lower store operating costs primarily reflected increased
labor productivity,  favorable food prices, led by lower cheese and meat prices,
and reduced advertising expenses, partially offset by increased spending for our
customer  satisfaction  program.  The profit  growth was  depressed by a net $17
million charge in 1995 composed of a $20 million  charge  recorded in the second
quarter for the relocation of certain functions of Pizza Hut's U.S. headquarters
from Wichita to Dallas,  partially  offset by net  favorable  adjustments  of $3
million  primarily as a result of better than expected costs. The ongoing profit
margin increased almost 2 points to 9.5%.

                                  1994 vs. 1993

Net sales  increased  $117  million  or 3%.  The  fifty-third  week  contributed
approximately  1 point to the sales growth.  The increased  sales were driven by
additional units that  contributed $271 million,  including $80 million from the
acquisition of D'Angelo late in 1993. This benefit was partially offset by lower
volumes of $105  million,  primarily  due to  lapping  the  successful  national
roll-out of Bigfoot Pizza in 1993, and lower net pricing. 
     Same store sales for  company-operated  units  declined 6%,  though  volume
decreased at a slightly  slower rate.  The decline was primarily in the delivery
and  carryout  channels,  reflecting  the  lapping of the  national  roll-out of
Bigfoot Pizza in 1993.
     Operating  profit  decreased  $53  million  or 16%.  The  fifty-third  week
mitigated  the profit  decline by  approximately  2 points.  The profit  decline
reflected lower volumes of $49 million ($60 million  excluding the impact of the
fifty-third  week),  lower net pricing and increased overhead costs, due in part
to increased  store closure  costs,  partially  offset by additional  units that
contributed  $17  million.  Store  operating  costs were  essentially  unchanged
primarily  reflecting  lower  advertising  and favorable food costs, as slightly
higher cheese prices were more than offset by favorable  meat prices,  offset by
increased  depreciation  attributable to new equipment related to Bigfoot Pizza.
Though difficult to forecast,  the prices of these key ingredients were expected
to decrease in 1995. The profit decline was also mitigated by a favorable impact
of $14 million from extending  depreciable lives on certain U.S. delivery assets
and the absence of last year's start-up costs associated with Bigfoot Pizza. The
profit margin declined almost 2 points to 7.7%.

                                  1995 vs. 1994

Net sales increased $163 million or 5%. The fifty-third week in 1994 reduced the
sales growth by  approximately 2 points.  The sales growth was led by additional
units which  contributed  $228 million.  A decline in restaurant  volume of $143
million, reflecting a 4% decline in same store sales for company-operated units,
was partially  offset by increased PFS sales to  franchisees  of $50 million.  A
decline in sales at HNN,  primarily  reflecting the absence of sales  associated
with  company-operated   units  licensed  in  1995  (see  below  for  additional
discussion),  was substantially  offset by increased sales at Chevys,  primarily
reflecting  additional  units.


<PAGE> 40


     Reported  operating profit declined $168 million or 62%. Ongoing  operating
profit  increased  $1  million.  Absent the  fifty-third  week in 1994,  ongoing
operating profit for 1995 would have increased 4 points.  The slight increase in
profit reflected a net gain of $40 million in 1995 ($42 million of refranchising
gains offset by $2 million of costs of closing other restaurants). This net gain
was offset by $12 million in 1995 for the  write-off  of costs  associated  with
sites that will not be developed (undeveloped sites),  compared to $6 million of
undeveloped  sites  costs in 1994.  Profit  growth was also aided by  additional
units  which  contributed  $23  million and lower  store  operating  costs.  The
decrease in store operating costs primarily  reflected  favorable food costs, as
lower  meat and bean  prices  were  partially  offset by higher  lettuce  prices
experienced in the second quarter.  Although difficult to forecast,  food prices
for the full year 1996 are expected to be favorable as compared to 1995,  led by
lower meat prices.  Profit growth also  reflected  increased  franchise  royalty
revenues,  in part  reflecting  initial  franchise fees related to  refranchised
restaurants,  and increased  license  fees.  These  benefits were  substantially
offset by net volume  declines of $44 million ($34 million  excluding the impact
of the fifty-third week) and a net unfavorable product mix shift to lower-margin
products.  The net volume  declines  resulted  from the reduced same store sales
partially offset by the  lower-margin  PFS increases.  Operating profit was also
adversely  impacted by roll-out costs incurred during the first half of the year
for the low-fat  Border Lights  products.  Increased  field  training costs were
offset by reduced headquarters administrative expenses.
     HNN and Chevys incurred $103 million of the initial charge upon adoption of
SFAS 121,  with HNN  responsible  for almost all of the  charge.  Excluding  the
initial charge, operating losses at Chevys increased, primarily reflecting costs
associated  with  a  curtailment  of  company-operated   restaurant  development
activities.  Excluding  the initial  charge,  HNN's losses  declined,  primarily
reflecting the absence of costs  associated with  undeveloped  sites in 1994. As
disclosed  in our 1994  Annual  Report and  updated in our 1995  reports on Form
10-Q, during 1995, Taco Bell initiated a plan to license or franchise all of its
HNN units in an effort to eliminate  HNN's operating  losses over time.  Through
the end of the third quarter, almost 75% of HNN's 200 units had been licensed or
franchised. Late in the fourth quarter, certain of the HNN licensees returned 42
of their units to Taco Bell as a result of poor operating results. Almost all of
these  units  were  closed,  de-identified  as HNN  units and are held for sale.
Subsequent  to  year-end,  our  largest  licensee  closed  and  returned  its 23
remaining units to Taco Bell. In addition,  there are some  indications that the
current operating performance of the majority of the remaining licensed units is
also below  expectations.  It is  reasonably  possible that some or all of these
underperforming  units may be returned  during 1996 by the licensees.  Any costs
associated  with units  returned in 1996 are expected to be  immaterial  to Taco
Bell's  results.  Taco Bell will  continue  its  efforts  to license or sell the
remaining company-operated HNN units and undeveloped sites.
     The Taco Bell ongoing profit margin declined nearly one-half point to 7.8%.

                                  1994 vs. 1993

Net sales  increased  $485 million or 17%. The  fifty-third  week  benefited the
sales growth by  approximately 2 points.  The sales growth was led by additional
units  which  contributed  $267  million  and volume  gains that  provided  $121
million,  half of which was the result of PFS food and paper sales to additional
franchisees.  The sales growth also reflected $84 

<PAGE> 41

million due to the  acquisition  of Chevys in the third  quarter of 1993 and new
Chevys units. Same store sales for company-operated units grew 2%, though volume
grew at a slower rate.
      Operating profit rose $17 million or 7%. The fifty-third week enhanced the
profit growth by approximately 4 points.  The profit growth reflected lower food
costs,  additional  units which  contributed  $25  million,  volume gains of $25
million ($15 million excluding the impact of the fifty-third week),  higher soft
drink prices and  increased  franchise  royalty  revenues.  These  benefits were
partially  offset by higher store  operating  costs,  driven by increased  labor
costs, an unfavorable mix shift to lower-margin products and higher headquarters
administrative expenses. Profit growth was restrained by increased losses posted
by HNN.  Taco Bell  planned to  transition  HNN  during  1995 from  primarily  a
company-operated to a  licensee/franchisee-operated  business. This was expected
to  significantly  reduce HNN's operating losses in 1995. The profit margin fell
almost 1 point to 8.2%.

                                  1995 vs. 1994

Net sales rose $80 million or 5%. The fifty-third week in 1994 reduced the sales
growth by  approximately  2 points.  The  increased  sales were driven by volume
gains of $61  million  and  higher  effective  net  pricing.  The  volume  gains
benefited from new product  offerings  during the year such as Colonel's  Crispy
Strips,  Chunky Chicken Pot Pies and a Tumble Marinated  Original Recipe product
as well as the national  introduction  of the  value-oriented  Mega Meal late in
1994,  which  was  complemented  by the 1995  high-end  "You'd Be Crazy To Cook"
offerings.  Same store sales for  company-operated  units advanced 7%, primarily
reflecting strong volume growth.
     Reported  operating profit decreased $63 million or 62%. Ongoing  operating
profit  increased  $2 million or 2%. The  fifty-third  week in 1994  reduced the
ongoing profit growth by  approximately  4 points.  The profit growth  reflected
volume gains of $18 million ($24 million excluding the impact of the fifty-third
week) and the higher effective net pricing.  Almost fully offsetting these gains
were increased store operating costs,  increased  overhead costs,  primarily for
new product  development,  reduced favorable actuarial  adjustments for casualty
claims  liabilities and losses  attributed to expanding  delivery  service.  The
higher store  operating costs  reflected  increased labor costs,  primarily as a
result of efforts to improve restaurant  quality and service.  The profit growth
was also  mitigated by $7 million of store  closure costs in 1995 compared to $5
million in 1994. The ongoing profit margin decreased slightly to 6.0%.

                                  1994 vs. 1993

Net sales rose $66 million or 4%. The fifty-third week contributed approximately
2 points to the sales  growth.  The  increased  sales  reflected  an increase in
volume of $49  million,  as gains from the  Colonel's  Rotisserie  Gold  roasted
chicken  product and  accompanying  side items  (collectively,  "CRG"),  and the
value-oriented  Mega Meal were  partially  offset by lower  volumes of  existing
products,  and higher net pricing.  Same store sales for company-operated  units
advanced  2%,  though  volumes grew at a slightly  slower rate. 
     Operating  profit  increased  $10  million  or 11%.  The  fifty-third  week
contributed  approximately 4 points to the profit growth.  The increased  profit
benefited from the absence of last year's  start-up costs  associated  with CRG.
Higher net pricing and volume gains of $16 million ($10  million  excluding  the
impact of the fifty-third  week) were offset by a mix shift to the  lower-margin
CRG and Mega Meal  offerings.  Reduced store  operating  costs,  including lower
product costs,  primarily due to  reformulation of side items late in the second
quarter,  and the 1994 impact of favorable actuarial  adjustments to prior years
workers'  compensation  claim  accruals,  were  partially  offset  by  increased
administrative  costs.  Profit  growth was  depressed  by lapping last year's $3
million favorable adjustment to a 1991 reorganization accrual. The profit margin
increased nearly one-half point to 6.2%.

                                  1995 vs. 1994

The KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell concepts represented approximately 55%, 40% and
5%,  respectively,  of total  international  restaurant  sales in 1995 and 1994.
     Net sales  increased  $299  million  or 16%,  with  Pizza Hut  representing
approximately  65% of the increased  sales. The fifty-third week in 1994 reduced
the  sales  growth by  approximately  2 points.  The  sales  increase  primarily
reflected additional units of $244 million.
     Reported  operating  profit  declined $92 million to a loss of $21 million.
Excluding the initial  charge upon adoption of SFAS 121, with Spain,  Canada and
Mexico  accounting  for almost three  quarters of the charge,  operating  profit
increased $43 million or 61%. Excluding shared overhead costs, Pizza Hut and KFC
contributed  about equally to the increased  operating  profit.  The fifty-third
week in 1994 reduced the ongoing operating profit

<PAGE> 44


growth rate by  approximately 7 points.  The increased  profit  reflected higher
effective net pricing,  additional units that contributed $22 million, increased
franchise royalty revenues and net favorable currency translation impacts. These
gains were partially  offset by higher store operating  costs,  led by increased
food  prices,  increased  administrative  and support  costs,  and a $17 million
reduction in volumes ($14 million excluding the impact of the fifty-third week).
The increased  administrative  and support costs  reflected  spending to support
country development strategies,  partially offset by lapping a $7 million charge
late in 1994 to consolidate  the  international  headquarters  operations in the
U.S.  of  the  three  concepts  and  the  related  savings  in  1995  from  this
consolidation  as well as savings from a  consolidation  of regional and country
headquarter  operations.  The ongoing  profit  margin  increased 1 1/2 points to
5.4%.  
     Following is a discussion of ongoing  operating profit by key international
market.  Increased profit in Australia,  our largest international sales market,
was  primarily  driven by the full  implementation  of its value  strategy,  the
adoption of store cost control  measures and a gain  resulting  from the sale of
several store properties  leased to a franchisee as well as the refranchising of
a few stores.  Profit gains in Korea primarily reflected additional units, while
higher  profit in New Zealand  primarily  reflected  volume  growth and acquired
units.  Profit also rose in Canada and the U.K.,  reflecting  higher guest check
averages and acquired units,  respectively.  Partially  offsetting  these profit
gains were  significantly  increased losses in Spain,  Mexico and Brazil.  Spain
reflected  closure  costs for a  significant  number of stores  scheduled  to be
closed in 1996,  poor  performance by new units,  volume  declines and increased
costs.  As discussed on pages 12 and 13,  results in Mexico have been  adversely
impacted by the economic difficulties resulting from the significant devaluation
of the Mexican peso. Net sales in Mexico  declined 44%, while  operating  losses
increased $8 million to $17 million,  reflecting lower volumes and higher costs,
which were only partially offset by higher  effective  pricing and the favorable
currency  translation  impact on  increased  local  currency  operating  losses.
Brazil's  increased  losses  were  primarily  due to higher  administrative  and
support costs.


                                  1994 vs. 1993

KFC,  Pizza  Hut  and  Taco  Bell  represented  approximately  55%,  40% and 5%,
respectively,  of total  international  sales in 1994 and 1993.  
     Net  sales  increased  $497  million  or 37%,  with KFC and  Pizza Hut each
contributing  about  equally  to  the  sales  increase.   The  fifty-third  week
contributed  approximately  2 points  to the  sales  growth.  The  sales  growth
primarily  reflected  additional units of $398 million and volume growth of $121
million, partially offset by lower net pricing.
     Operating  profit  declined  $22 million or 24%.  The decline in  operating
profit was due to Pizza Hut. The  fifty-third  week mitigated the rate of profit
decline by  approximately  3 points.  The decreased  profit  reflected lower net
pricing,  increased  administrative  and support costs,  primarily to support an
extraordinary  rate of unit  development,  higher store operating costs and a $7
million charge to consolidate  the  headquarters  operations in the U.S. for the
three international restaurant concepts into one. These were partially offset by
increased  volumes  of $52  million  ($49  million  excluding  the impact of the
fifty-third  week),  additional  units that  contributed  $29 million and higher
franchise royalty revenues.
     Following is a discussion of operating profit by key international  market.
Australia,  our largest  international  sales market, had slightly lower profit.
Korea's operating profit increased significantly, driven by additional units and
volume gains. Profit declined sharply

<PAGE> 45

in Mexico and Canada,  due in part to  increased  administrative  costs.  Brazil
incurred  an  operating  loss as a result of losses on  acquired  units.  Poland
experienced additional start-up losses from new operations.  Profit increases in
New  Zealand  and  the  U.K.   reflected   volume  gains  and  acquired   units,
respectively. The profit margin declined more than 3 points to 3.9%.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION

ASSETS increased $640 million or 3% to $25.4 billion. The increase reflected the
normal growth of the businesses,  partially  offset by the impact of the initial
charge  of $520  million  upon  adoption  of SFAS  121  (see  Note 2)  primarily
affecting property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and, to a much lesser
extent,  investments in unconsolidated  affiliates and other noncurrent  assets.
Increased accounts and notes receivable  reflected slower collections and volume
advances in worldwide beverages and snack foods.  Short-term investments largely
represent high-grade  marketable securities portfolios held outside the U.S. Our
portfolio in Puerto Rico,  which  totaled $816 million at year-end 1995 and $853
million at year-end 1994,  arises from the operating cash flows of a centralized
concentrate  manufacturing  facility that operates under a tax incentive  grant.
The grant provides that the portfolio funds may be remitted to the U.S.  without
any additional tax.  PepsiCo  remitted $792 million of the portfolio to the U.S.
in  1995  and  $380  million  in  1994.  PepsiCo   continually   reassesses  its
alternatives to redeploy its maturing  investments in this and other  portfolios
held outside the U.S., considering other investment opportunities and risks, tax
consequences and overall financing strategies.
      LIABILITIES  rose $183  million or 1% to $18.1  billion.  The $643 million
increase in other long-term  liabilities was partially  offset by a $304 million
reduction  in debt.  The  increase  in  other  long-term  liabilities  primarily
reflected   normal  growth  and  a   reclassification   of  amounts  to  current
liabilities.
      At year-end 1995 and 1994, $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, of
short-term borrowings were classified as long-term,  reflecting PepsiCo's intent
and ability, through the existence of its unused revolving credit facilities, to
refinance  these  borrowings.  PepsiCo's  unused credit  facilities with lending
institutions,  which  exist  largely  to support  the  issuances  of  short-term
borrowings,  were $3.5 billion at year-end 1995 and 1994.  Effective  January 3,
1995,  PepsiCo  replaced its existing credit  facilities  with revolving  credit
facilities aggregating $4.5 billion, of which $1.0 billion was to expire in 1996
and $3.5  billion was to expire in 2000.  Effective  December  8, 1995,  PepsiCo
terminated  the  $1.0  billion  due to  expire  in  1996  based  upon a  current
assessment of the amount of credit  facilities  required compared to its related
cost.  The  expiration  of the remaining  credit  facilities of $3.5 billion was
extended to 2001. Annually,  these facilities can be extended an additional year
upon the mutual consent of PepsiCo and the lending institutions.

      FINANCIAL  LEVERAGE  is  measured  by PepsiCo  on both a market  value and
historical cost basis. PepsiCo believes that the most meaningful measure of debt
is on a net basis, which takes into account its large investment portfolios held
outside  the U.S.  These  portfolios  are managed as part of  PepsiCo's  overall
financing  strategy and are not required to support day-to-day  operations.  Net
debt reflects the pro forma  remittance of the portfolios (net of related taxes)
as a reduction of total debt. Total debt includes the present value of operating
lease commitments.

       RATIO

      PepsiCo believes that market leverage (defined as net debt as a percent of
net debt plus the market value of equity,  based on the year-end stock price) is
an  appropriate  measure  of  PepsiCo's  long-term  financial  leverage.  Unlike
historical  cost  measures,  the market value of equity  primarily  reflects the
estimated net present value of expected future cash flows that will both support
debt and provide  returns to  shareholders.  PepsiCo has established a long-term
target  range of 20%-25% for its market net debt ratio to  optimize  its cost of
capital.
      The market net debt ratio  declined 8 points to 18% at  year-end  1995 due
primarily to a 54% increase in PepsiCo's  stock price.  The 4 point  increase to
26% at year-end  1994 was due to a 13% decline in PepsiCo's  stock price as well
as an 8% increase in net debt.
      As measured  on an  historical  cost  basis,  the ratio of net debt to net
capital employed (defined as net debt, other liabilities,  deferred income taxes
and shareholders'  equity) declined 3 points to 46%,  reflecting a 2% decline in
net debt and a 4% increase in net capital  employed.  The 1 point decline to 49%
at year-end  1994 was due to a 9% increase  in net capital  employed,  partially
offset by the increase in net debt.
      Because of  PepsiCo's  strong cash  generating  capability  and its strong
financial condition,  PepsiCo has continued access to capital markets throughout
the world.
      At year-end 1995, about 62% of PepsiCo's net debt portfolio, including the
effects  of  interest  rate and  currency  swaps  (see Note 8),  was  exposed to
variable interest rates,  compared to about 60% in 1994. In addition to variable
rate  long-term  debt,  all net debt  with  maturities  of less than one year is
categorized as variable.  PepsiCo  prefers  funding its operations with variable
rate debt  because it believes  that,  over the  long-term,  variable  rate debt
provides more cost effective  financing than fixed rate debt. PepsiCo will issue
fixed rate debt if advantageous market  opportunities arise. A 1 point change in
interest rates on variable rate net debt would impact annual  interest  expense,
net of interest income,  by approximately  $36 million ($19 million after-tax or
$0.02 per share)  assuming  the level and mix of the  December 30, 1995 net debt
portfolio were maintained.
      PepsiCo's negative  operating working capital position,  which principally
reflects  the  cash  sales  nature  of its  restaurant  operations,  effectively
provides  additional  capital for investment.  Operating working capital,  which
excludes short-term  investments and short-term  borrowings,  was a negative $94
million  and $677  million at  year-end  1995 and 1994,  respectively.  The $583
million   decline  in  negative   working   capital   primarily   reflected  the
reclassification of amounts from long-term to current liabilities, base business
growth in the

more working capital intensive bottling and snack food operations  exceeding the
growth in restaurant operations and an increase in prepaid taxes.
      SHAREHOLDERS'  EQUITY  increased $457 million or 7% to $7.3 billion.  This
 change reflected a 13% increase in retained earnings due to $1.6 billion in net
 income less  dividends  declared of $615 million.  This growth was reduced by a
 $337 million unfavorable change in the currency translation  adjustment account
 (CTA) and a $322 million increase in treasury stock,  reflecting repurchases of
 12 million shares offset by 10 million shares used for stock option  exercises.
 The CTA change primarily reflected the effects of the Mexican peso devaluation.

 RETURN ON AVERAGE SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
      Based on income before cumulative effect of accounting changes,  PepsiCo's
 return  on  average  shareholders'  equity  was 23% and 27% in 1995  and  1994,
 respectively.  Excluding  the initial  charge upon adoption of SFAS 121 in 1995
 (see Note 2) and the 1994  BAESA  gain (see Note  16),  the  return on  average
 shareholders' equity was 27% in 1995 and 1994.

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS

Cash flow activity in 1995 reflected  strong cash flows from  operations of $3.7
billion  which were used to fund  capital  spending  of $2.1  billion,  dividend
payments of $599 million,  purchases of treasury stock totaling $541 million and
acquisition and investment activity of $466 million.

      One of PepsiCo's most significant financial strengths is its internal cash
generation capability. In fact, after capital spending and acquisitions, each of
our three  industry  segments  generated  positive  cash  flows in 1995,  led by
restaurants,  which  generated  nearly  $600  million in cash flow  compared  to
marginally  positive  cash flows in 1994.  Net cash flows  from  PepsiCo's  U.S.
businesses  were  partially  offset by  international  uses of cash,  reflecting
strategies to accelerate growth of international operations.

Net cash  provided by operating  activities  in 1995 rose $26 million or 1% over
1994,  and in 1994,  grew $582 million or 19% over 1993.  Income before  noncash
charges and credits rose 13% in 1995 and 7% in 1994.  Increased  noncash charges
of $646 million in 1995  reflected the $520 million  initial,  noncash impact of
adopting SFAS 121 and increased  depreciation and  amortization  charges of $163
million,  partially  offset by  increased  deferred  income tax  benefits of $44
million,  primarily  resulting  from the  adoption of SFAS 121.  The $29 million
increase in 1994 reflected  increased  depreciation and amortization  charges of
$133  million  and a  decrease  of  $150  million  in the  deferred  income  tax
provision,  primarily due to the effect in 1994 of converting from premium-based
casualty  insurance to self-insurance for most of these risks, and adopting SFAS
112 for accounting for  postemployment  benefits.  The working  capital net cash
outflows of $411 million in 1995 compared to cash inflows of $31 million in 1994
primarily  reflected  increased  growth  in  accounts  and notes  receivable,  a
decrease  in income  taxes  payable in 1995  compared to an increase in 1994 and
reduced growth in other current liabilities in 1995 compared to 1994,  partially
offset by increased growth in accounts  payable,  led by U.S.  beverages,  and a
reduction in the amounts prefunded in 1995 for employee benefits.  The growth in
accounts and notes receivable was driven by worldwide beverages, which reflected
slower  collections  and volume growth.  The 1994 over 1993 net increase of $357
million  reflected  normal  increases in accrued  liabilities  across all of our
businesses,  lapping  the  effect  of higher  income  tax  payments  and a lower
provision in 1993, and improved trade receivable  collections,  partially offset
by the impact on accounts  payable of the timing of a large year-end  payment to
prefund employee benefits.

Investing  activities over the past three years reflected strategic  investments
in all three industry  segments through capital  spending,  and acquisitions and
investments in unconsolidated affiliates.  PepsiCo's investments are expected to
generate  cash  returns in excess of its  long-term  cost of  capital,  which is
estimated to be approximately 10% at year-end 1995. See Note 17 for a discussion
of acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated  affiliates.  About 85% of the
total  acquisition  and investment  activity in 1995  represented  international
transactions compared to 75% in 1994. PepsiCo continues to seek opportunities to
strengthen its position in its industry segments,  particularly in beverages and
snack foods, through strategic acquisitions.

      The  $149  million   decline  in  capital   spending  in  1995   reflected
substantially  reduced  spending in restaurants,  consistent with our restaurant
strategy discussed on page 33. Increased U.S. snack food spending, primarily for
capacity  expansion  and new  products,  was  partially  offset by a decline  in
beverages. Increased capital spending of $271 million in 1994 reflected beverage
investments  in  equipment  for new  packaging  and new products in the U.S. and
emerging international markets, primarily Eastern Europe.  International capital
spending  represented  29%, 35% and 31% of total segment  spending in 1995, 1994
and 1993, respectively.  Beverages,  snack foods and restaurants represent about
30%, 40% and 30%, respectively, of the $2.5 billion of planned spending in 1996.
This reflects the continued  shift from  restaurants to snack foods.  Snack food
and beverage 1996 capital spending reflects  production  capacity  expansion for
both  established  and  new  products,  and  equipment  replacements.   Although
restaurant  spending in 1996 is expected to be about equal to 1995's  level,  we
expect more of the  spending in 1996 to be used for  refurbishing  our  existing
restaurants and less spent on new store  development.  Approximately  25% of the
planned 1996 capital spending relates to international businesses.

<PAGE> 50

      Consistent with management's  strategy to improve  restaurant returns (see
Management's  Analysis  -  Restaurants  on page  33),  proceeds  from  sales  of
restaurants  in  1995  were  $165  million.   Although  difficult  to  forecast,
management  anticipates  continued cash flow from this kind of activity over the
next few years.
     As  discussed  in  Financial  Leverage  on page  46,  PepsiCo  manages  the
investment  activity in its  short-term  portfolios,  primarily held outside the
U.S., as part of its overall financing strategy.

The net cash  flow used for  financing  activities  in 1995 was about  even with
1994.  In 1995,  increased  proceeds  from  exercises  of stock  options of $155
million were offset by increased net  repayments of short and long-term  debt of
$98 million and higher cash  dividends  paid of $59 million.  The 1994 over 1993
change  in cash  flows  from  financing  activities  was a use of $937  million,
primarily  reflecting  net repayment of short and long-term debt of $205 million
compared to net proceeds of $590 million in 1993.
     Cash dividends declared were $615 million in 1995 and $555 million in 1994.
PepsiCo  targets a dividend payout of about one-third of the prior year's income
from ongoing operations, thus retaining sufficient earnings to provide financial
resources for growth opportunities.
     Share repurchase  decisions are evaluated  considering  management's target
capital  structure  and  other  investment  opportunities.  PepsiCo  expects  to
repurchase  at least 1% to 2% of its  outstanding  shares each year for the next
several years.  During 1995, PepsiCo  repurchased 1.6% of its shares outstanding
at the  beginning of 1995,  or 12.3 million  shares,  at a cost of $541 million.
Subsequent to year-end,  PepsiCo repurchased 1.7 million shares through February
6, 1996 at a cost of $99 million.  During 1994, PepsiCo  repurchased 1.9% of the
shares  outstanding at the beginning of 1994, or 15.0 million shares,  at a cost
of $549  million.  Through  February  6, 1996,  29.4  million  shares  have been
repurchased under the 50 million share repurchase authority granted by PepsiCo's
Board of Directors in July 1993. In February 1996,  PepsiCo's Board of Directors
replaced the 1993 share repurchase authority with a new authority for 50 million
shares.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(tabular dollars in millions except per share amounts)

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The  preparation of the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and  assumptions  that affect  reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
     To  facilitate  the closing  process,  certain of  PepsiCo's  international
operations close their fiscal year up to one month earlier than PepsiCo's fiscal
year. 
     Certain  reclassifications  were made to prior year amounts to conform with
the 1995 presentation.  
     ACCOUNTING CHANGES. As discussed below and in Note 2, in 1995 PepsiCo early
adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  121  (SFAS  121),
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed  Of." In 1994,  PepsiCo  adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 112, "Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," (see Note 14) and a
preferred method of calculating the market-related  value of plan assets used in
determining  pension  expense  (see  Note  13).   
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123), "Accounting
for Stock-Based  Compensation,"  permits stock  compensation cost to be measured
using either the intrinsic  value-based  method or the fair value-based  method.
When  adopted  in  1996,  PepsiCo  intends  to  continue  to use  the  intrinsic
value-based  method and will provide the expanded  disclosures  required by SFAS
123.
     PRINCIPLES  OF  CONSOLIDATION.   The  financial   statements   reflect  the
consolidated   accounts  of  PepsiCo,   Inc.  and  its  controlled   affiliates.
Intercompany  accounts and  transactions  have been  eliminated.  Investments in
unconsolidated  affiliates in which PepsiCo exercises  significant influence but
not control are accounted  for by the equity  method and PepsiCo's  share of the
net  income or loss of its  affiliates  is  included  in  selling,  general  and
administrative expenses.
     FISCAL YEAR.  PepsiCo's  fiscal year ends on the last  Saturday in December
and,  as a result,  a  fifty-third  week is added  every five or six years.  The
fiscal year ending December 31, 1994 consisted of 53 weeks.
     MARKETING  COSTS.  Marketing  costs are  reported in  selling,  general and
administrative  expenses  and  include  costs  of  advertising,   marketing  and
promotional  programs.  Promotional discounts are expensed as incurred and other
marketing  costs not  deferred  at year-end  are  charged to expense  ratably in
relation to sales over the year in which  incurred.  Marketing costs deferred at
year-end,  which are classified in prepaid expenses in the Consolidated  Balance
Sheet,   consist  of  media  and  personal  service   advertising   prepayments,
promotional  materials  in  inventory  and  production  costs  of  future  media
advertising; these assets are expensed in the year first used.
     Promotional  discounts to retailers in the beverage  segment are classified
as a reduction of sales; in the snack food segment, such discounts are generally
classified as marketing  costs.  The difference in  classification  reflects our
view that  promotional  discounts  are so pervasive  in the  beverage  industry,
compared to the snack food industry,  that they are effectively  price discounts
and  should  be  classified  accordingly.  A current  survey  of the  accounting
practice of others in the 

<PAGE> F-9


beverage and snack food industries confirmed that our beverage classification is
consistent  with  others in that  industry  while  practice  in the  snack  food
industry is mixed.
     Advertising  expense was $1.8  billion,  $1.7  billion and $1.6  billion in
1995, 1994 and 1993,  respectively.  Prepaid advertising as of year-end 1995 and
1994 was $78 million and $70 million, respectively.
     RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. Research and development expenses, which
are  expensed as incurred,  were $96  million,  $152 million and $113 million in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. PepsiCo uses the intrinsic value-based method for
measuring stock-based  compensation cost which measures compensation cost as the
excess,  if any, of the quoted  market price of PepsiCo's  capital  stock at the
grant date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock. PepsiCo's policy
is to grant stock  options at fair market value at the date of grant. 
     NET INCOME PER SHARE.  Net income per share is  computed  by  dividing  net
income by the weighted  average number of shares and dilutive share  equivalents
(primarily  stock  options)   outstanding  during  each  year  ("average  shares
outstanding"). 
     DERIVATIVE  INSTRUMENTS.  PepsiCo's  policy prohibits the use of derivative
instruments for trading  purposes and PepsiCo has procedures in place to monitor
and control their use.
     PepsiCo  enters into interest rate and currency swaps with the objective of
reducing  borrowing  costs.  Interest  rate  and  currency  swaps  are  used  to
effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. In
general,  the terms of these swaps  match the terms of the related  debt and the
swaps are  entered  into  concurrently  with the  issuance  of the debt they are
intended  to modify.  The  interest  differential  to be paid or  received on an
interest rate swap is  recognized  as an  adjustment to interest  expense as the
differential  occurs.  The  interest  differential  not yet  settled  in cash is
reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a receivable or payable under the
appropriate  current  asset or  liability  caption.  If an  interest  rate  swap
position was to be terminated,  the gain or loss realized upon termination would
be deferred and  amortized to interest  expense over the  remaining  term of the
underlying  debt  instrument  it was  intended to modify or would be  recognized
immediately if the underlying debt instrument was settled prior to maturity. The
differential to be paid or received on a currency swap is charged or credited to
income as the  differential  occurs.  This is fully offset by the  corresponding
gain or loss  recognized  in income on the currency  translation  of the related
non-U.S.  dollar  denominated  debt,  as both  amounts  are based  upon the same
exchange rates.  The currency  differential not yet settled in cash is reflected
in the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet under the appropriate  current or noncurrent
receivable or payable caption.  If a currency swap position was to be terminated
prior  to  maturity,  the  gain or  loss  realized  upon  termination  would  be
immediately  recognized  in income.
     A seven-year put option, issued in connection with the formation of a joint
venture with the principal  shareholder of GEMEX, an  unconsolidated  franchised
bottling  affiliate in Mexico (see Note 17), is  marked-to-market  with gains or
losses  recognized  currently as an  adjustment  to  PepsiCo's  share of the net
income of unconsolidated  affiliates. The offsetting amount adjusts the carrying
amount  of  the  put  obligation,   classified  in  other   liabilities  in  the
Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.   
     Gains  and  losses  on  futures  contracts  designated  as hedges of future
commodity  purchases  are  deferred  and included in the cost of the related raw
materials when purchased. Changes in the value of futures contracts that PepsiCo
uses to hedge  commodity  purchases are highly  correlated to the 


<PAGE> F-10

changes in the value of the purchased  commodity.  If the degree of  correlation
between the futures  contracts and the purchase  contracts were to diminish such
that the two were no longer considered highly correlated,  subsequent changes in
the value of the futures contracts would be recognized in income.
     CASH EQUIVALENTS.  Cash equivalents  represent funds  temporarily  invested
(with  original  maturities  not  exceeding  three  months) as part of PepsiCo's
management of day-to-day  operating cash receipts and  disbursements.  All other
investment  portfolios,  largely held outside the U.S., are primarily classified
as short-term investments. 
     INVENTORIES.  Inventories  are valued at the lower of cost (computed on the
average,  first-in,  first-out  or  last-in,  first-out  [LIFO]  method)  or net
realizable value.
     PROPERTY,  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  Property,  plant and equipment  (PP&E) are
stated at cost except for PP&E that have been  impaired,  for which the carrying
amount  is  reduced  to  estimated  fair  value.   Depreciation   is  calculated
principally  on a  straight-line  basis over the  estimated  useful lives of the
assets.
     INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis
over appropriate periods, generally ranging from 20 to 40 years.
     RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED IN THE BUSINESS. As
noted above,  PepsiCo early adopted SFAS 121 in 1995 for purposes of determining
and measuring impairment of certain long-lived assets to be held and used in the
business. See Note 2.
     PepsiCo reviews most long-lived assets,  certain  identifiable  intangibles
and  goodwill  related to those  assets to be held and used in the  business for
impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that the
carrying amount of an asset or a group of assets may not be recoverable. PepsiCo
considers a history of operating losses to be its primary indicator of potential
impairment.  Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level
for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely  independent of the
cash flows of other  groups of assets  ("Assets").  PepsiCo has  identified  the
appropriate  grouping of Assets to be individual  restaurants for the restaurant
segment  and,  for each of the snack  food and  beverage  segments,  Assets  are
generally grouped at the country level. PepsiCo deems an Asset to be impaired if
a forecast of undiscounted  future  operating cash flows directly related to the
Asset,  including disposal value if any, is less than its carrying amount. If an
Asset is determined to be impaired,  the loss is measured as the amount by which
the carrying amount of the Asset exceeds its fair value.  Fair value is based on
quoted market prices in active  markets,  if available.  If quoted market prices
are not  available,  an estimate of fair value is based on the best  information
available,  including  prices for  similar  assets or the  results of  valuation
techniques such as discounting estimated future cash flows as if the decision to
continue  to use the  impaired  Asset  was a new  investment  decision.  PepsiCo
generally  measures  fair value by  discounting  estimated  future  cash  flows.
Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash
flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.
     Recoverability  of  other  long-lived  assets,   primarily  investments  in
unconsolidated   affiliates  and  identifiable   intangibles  and  goodwill  not
identified with impaired Assets covered by the above paragraph, will continue to
be evaluated on a recurring basis. The primary  indicators of recoverability are
current or forecasted  profitability over the estimated  remaining life of these
assets,  based on the operating  profit of the  businesses  directly  related to
these  assets.  If  recoverability  is  unlikely  based on the  evaluation,  the
carrying  amount is reduced by the amount it exceeds  the  forecasted  operating
profit and any estimated disposal value.

NOTE 2 -IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
PepsiCo early adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 121 (SFAS
121),  "Accounting  for the  Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed  Of," as of the  beginning of the fourth  quarter of 1995.
This date was chosen to allow  adequate time to collect and analyze data related
to the  long-lived  assets of each of our worldwide  operations  for purposes of
identifying, measuring and reporting any impairment in 1995.
     The  initial,  noncash  charge upon  adoption of SFAS 121 was $520  million
($384  million  after-tax or $0.48 per share),  which  included $68 million ($49
million  after-tax or $0.06 per share) related to restaurants  for which closure
decisions were made during the fourth quarter. This initial charge resulted from
PepsiCo  grouping  assets at a lower  level than under its  previous  accounting
policy  for  evaluating  and  measuring  impairment.  Under  PepsiCo's  previous
accounting  policy,   each  of  PepsiCo's  operating   divisions'   ("Division")
long-lived  assets to be held and used by the  Division,  other than  intangible
assets,  were  evaluated as a group for impairment if the Division was incurring
operating  losses or was  expected  to incur  operating  losses  in the  future.
Because of the strong  operating  profit history and prospects of each Division,
no  impairment  evaluation  had been  required for 1994 or 1993 under  PepsiCo's
previous  accounting  policy.  The initial charge represented a reduction of the
carrying  amounts  of the  impaired  Assets  (as  defined  in Note  1) to  their
estimated fair value, as determined by using  discounted  estimated  future cash
flows.  Considerable  management  judgment is necessary  to estimate  discounted
future cash flows.  Accordingly,  actual results could vary  significantly  from
such  estimates.  This  charge  affected  worldwide  restaurants,  international
beverages  and, to a much lesser extent,  international  snack foods and certain
unconsolidated affiliates. See Note 19.
     As a  result  of  the  reduced  carrying  amount  of the  impaired  Assets,
depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter of 1995 was reduced
by $21 million ($15 million  after-tax  or $0.02 per share) and  full-year  1996
depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be reduced by approximately
$58  million  ($39  million  after-tax  or $0.05 per  share).  See  Management's
Analysis -  Restaurants  on page 33 for a discussion  of other  possible  future
effects related to this change in accounting. 
     SFAS 121 also requires, among other provisions,  that long-lived assets and
certain  identifiable  intangibles to be disposed of that are not covered by APB
Opinion No. 30,  "Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
Occurring  Events and  Transactions,"  be  reported  at the lower of the asset's
carrying amount or its fair value less cost to sell.  Under  PepsiCo's  previous
accounting  policy,  PepsiCo reported an asset to be disposed of at the lower of
its  carrying  amount or its  estimated  net  realizable  value.  There  were no
material  adjustments  to the  carrying  amounts of assets to be  disposed of in
1995, 1994 or 1993 under PepsiCo's  previous  accounting  policy.  The impact of
adopting SFAS 121 on assets held for disposal during 1995 was immaterial.

NOTE 3 - ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY

The  effect on  comparability  of 1995 net gains from  sales of  restaurants  to
franchisees in excess of the cost of closing other restaurants is provided under
Net  Refranchising  Gains in Note 19. 
     The  fifty-third  week in 1994,  as described  under Fiscal Year in Note 1,
increased  1994  net  sales  by  an  estimated  $434  million  and  earnings  by
approximately $54 million ($35 million after-tax or $0.04 per share). See Fiscal
Year  in  Note  19  for  the  estimated   impact  of  the  fifty-third  week  on
comparability of segment net sales and operating profit.
     The  effects  of  unusual  items  on  comparability  of  operating  profit,
primarily  restructuring  charges and  accounting  changes,  are provided  under
Unusual Items and Accounting Changes, respectively, in Note 19.
      Information regarding the 1994 gain from a public share offering by BAESA,
an unconsolidated franchised bottling affiliate in South America, and a 1993
charge to increase net deferred tax liabilities as of the beginning of 1993 for
a 1% statutory income tax rate increase due to 1993 U.S. Federal tax legislation
is provided in Notes 16 and 11, respectively.

Identifiable  intangible  assets primarily arose from the allocation of purchase
prices of businesses  acquired and consist  principally of reacquired  franchise
rights and  trademarks.  Reacquired  franchise  rights relate to acquisitions of
franchised bottling and restaurant operations and trademarks  principally relate
to acquisitions of  international  snack food and beverage  businesses.  Amounts
assigned to such identifiable  intangibles were based on independent  appraisals
or internal  estimates.  Goodwill  represents the residual  purchase price after
allocation  to all  identifiable  net  assets.  
     Accumulated  amortization,  included in the amounts above, was $1.8 billion
and $1.6 billion at year-end 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  The adoption of SFAS
121 reduced the carrying amount of intangible  assets,  net by $86 million.  See
Note 2.

NOTE 7 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

PepsiCo's  policy  prohibits  the  use of  derivative  instruments  for  trading
purposes and PepsiCo has procedures in place to monitor and control their use.
     PepsiCo's use of derivative  instruments  is primarily  limited to interest
rate and currency  swaps,  which are entered into with the objective of reducing
borrowing costs. PepsiCo enters into interest rate and foreign currency swaps to
effectively  change the interest rate and currency of specific  debt  issuances.
These swaps are  generally  entered into  concurrently  with the issuance of the
debt they are intended to modify.  The notional  amount,  interest payment dates
and maturity dates of the swaps match the principal,  interest payment dates and
maturity  dates of the related  debt.  Accordingly,  any market  impact (risk or
opportunity)  associated with these swaps is fully offset by the opposite market
impact on the related debt.  PepsiCo's  credit risk related to interest rate and
currency  swaps is considered low because they are only entered into with strong
creditworthy  counterparties,  are  generally  settled on a net basis and are of
relatively short duration. See Note 8 for the notional amounts, related interest
rates and  maturities  of the interest  rate and  currency  swaps along with the
original  terms of the  related  debt  and  Note 9 for the  fair  value of these
instruments.

<PAGE> F-14

In 1995, PepsiCo issued a seven-year put option in connection with the formation
of a joint venture with the principal  shareholder of GEMEX,  an  unconsolidated
franchised  bottling  affiliate in Mexico.  The put option  allows the principal
shareholder  to sell up to 150 million  GEMEX  shares to PepsiCo at 66 2/3 cents
per share.  PepsiCo  accounts  for this put option by marking it to market  with
gains or losses recognized currently. The put option liability, which was valued
at $26 million at the date of the original transaction, increased to $30 million
by year-end, resulting in a $4 million charge to earnings.

The interest rates in the above table indicate, where applicable, the weighted

<PAGE> F-15


respectively, prior to the effects of any interest rate swaps. See (A) below for
PepsiCo's  weighted  average interest rates after giving effect to the impact of
the interest  rate swaps.  
     The carrying  amount of  long-term  debt  includes any related  discount or
premium and unamortized debt issuance costs. The debt agreements include various
restrictions, none of which are currently significant to PepsiCo.
     The annual  maturities of long-term  debt through 2000,  excluding  capital
lease obligations and the reclassified  short-term  borrowings,  are:  1996-$1.4
billion,  1997-$1.5 billion,  1998-$1.5 billion, 1999-$572 million and 2000-$651
million.

PepsiCo pays,  which are primarily  indexed to either  commercial paper or LIBOR
rates,  are  based on  rates as of the  respective  balance  sheet  date and are
subject to change. Terms of interest rate swaps generally match the terms of the
debt they modify and the swaps terminate in 1996 through 2010.

     (B) Included  certain  long-term notes  aggregating  $248 million which are
reasonably  expected  to be called,  without  penalty,  by PepsiCo in 1996.  The
expectation  is based  upon the belief of PepsiCo  management  that,  based upon
projected yield curves,  our  counterparties to interest rate swaps,  which were
entered  into to  modify  these  notes,  will  exercise  their  option  to early
terminate the swaps  without  penalty.  Also included the $214 million  carrying
amount of the Swiss franc  perpetual  Foreign  Interest  Payment  bonds (see (E)
below).  
     (C) PepsiCo has entered into currency  swaps to hedge its foreign  currency
exposure on non-U.S.  dollar  denominated  debt. At year-end 1995, the aggregate
carrying  amount of the debt was $696 million and the  receivables  and payables
under  related  currency  swaps were $5 million and $12  million,  respectively,
resulting  in a net  effective  U.S.  dollar  liability  of $703  million with a
weighted  average  interest  rate of 5.8%,  including  the  effects  of  related
interest  rate  swaps.  At  year-end  1994,  the  carrying  amount  of this debt
aggregated $301 million and the receivables and payables under related  currency
swaps  aggregated $50 million and $2 million,  respectively,  resulting in a net
effective U.S. dollar liability of $253 million with a weighted average interest
rate of 7.9%, including the effects of related interest rate swaps.
     (D) At  year-end  1995  and  1994,  PepsiCo  had  unused  revolving  credit
facilities  covering potential  borrowings  aggregating $3.5 billion.  Effective
January 3, 1995,  PepsiCo  replaced  its  existing  credit  facilities  with new
revolving credit facilities  aggregating $4.5 billion, of which $1.0 billion was
to expire in 1996 and $3.5 billion was to expire in 2000.  Effective December 8,
1995,  PepsiCo  terminated  the $1.0  billion due to expire in 1996 based upon a
current  assessment of the amount of credit facilities  required compared to its
related cost. The expiration of the remaining credit  facilities of $3.5 billion
was extended to 2001. At year-end 1995 and 1994,  $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion,
respectively,  of  short-term  borrowings  were  classified  as long-term  debt,
reflecting  PepsiCo's  intent and ability,  through the  existence of the unused
credit facilities, to refinance these borrowings.  These credit facilities exist
largely to support the issuances of short-term  borrowings and are available for
acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.

     (E) The  coupon  rate of the Swiss  franc  400  million  perpetual  Foreign
Interest  Payment bonds issued in 1986 is 7 1/2% through 1996. The bonds have no
stated  maturity  date. At the end of each 10-year  period after the issuance of
the bonds,  PepsiCo and the bondholders  each have the right to cause redemption
of the bonds.  If not  redeemed,  the coupon rate will be adjusted  based on the
prevailing yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury Securities. The principal of the bonds
is denominated in Swiss francs.  PepsiCo can, and intends to, limit the ultimate
redemption amount to the U.S. dollar proceeds at issuance, which is the basis of
the  carrying  amount.  Interest  payments  are  made  in U.S.  dollars  and are
calculated  by applying the coupon rate to the original  U.S.  dollar  principal
proceeds of $214 million.  Although  PepsiCo does not currently  intend to cause
redemption of this debt,  this debt has been  included in current  maturities of
long-term  debt (see (B) above) at year-end  1995  because the  bondholders  may
exercise  their right to cause PepsiCo to redeem the debt in 1996 on its 10-year
anniversary date. Since the redemption feature is only available on each 10-year
anniversary date, the bonds will be reclassified to long-term if redemption does
not occur in 1996.

various dates through 2000.
     Because  of  the  short  maturity  of  cash   equivalents   and  short-term

NOTE 10 - LEASES

PepsiCo has noncancelable commitments under both capital and long-term operating
leases,  primarily for restaurant  units.  In addition,  PepsiCo is lessee under
noncancelable leases covering vehicles, equipment and nonrestaurant real estate.
Capital and  operating  lease  commitments  expire at various dates through 2088
and,  in many cases,  provide for rent  escalations  and renewal  options.  Most
leases require payment of related executory costs, which include property taxes,
maintenance  and  insurance.   Sublease  income  and  sublease  receivables  are
insignificant.
      Future minimum commitments under noncancelable leases are set forth below:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      At year-end 1995, the present value of minimum payments under capital
leases was $294 million, after deducting $1 million for estimated executory
costs and $253 million representing imputed interest.

     PepsiCo operates centralized concentrate manufacturing facilities in Puerto
Rico and Ireland under  long-term tax  incentives.  The U.S. amount in the above
table included  approximately  70% in 1995 and 50% in 1994 and 1993  (consistent
with the income  subject to U.S.  tax) of the income  from sales of  concentrate
manufactured  in Puerto Rico.  The increase in 1995 reflected the effects of the
1993 Federal income tax  legislation,  which limited the U.S. Federal tax credit
on income earned in Puerto Rico. See  Management's  Analysis - Significant  U.S.
Tax Changes Affecting  Historical and Future Results on page 15 for a discussion
of the  reduction  of the U.S.  Federal  tax  credit  associated  with  beverage
concentrate operations in Puerto Rico.

     The valuation  allowance  related to deferred tax assets  increased by $179
million in 1995,  primarily  resulting  from  additions  related to current year
operating losses in a number of state and foreign jurisdictions and the adoption
of SFAS 121.

<PAGE> F-22

     In accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles,  deferred tax
liabilities have not been recognized for bases  differences that are essentially
permanent in duration  related to investments in foreign  subsidiaries and joint
ventures.  These  differences,  which consist  primarily of unremitted  earnings
intended to be indefinitely reinvested, aggregated approximately $4.5 billion at
year-end  1995 and $3.8 billion at year-end  1994,  exclusive of amounts that if
remitted in the future would  result in little or no tax under  current tax laws
and the  Puerto  Rico  tax  incentive  grant.  Determination  of the  amount  of
unrecognized deferred tax liabilities is not practicable.
     Net operating loss carryforwards totaling $2.3 billion at year-end 1995 are
available  to reduce  future tax of certain  subsidiaries  and are  related to a
number of state and foreign jurisdictions.  Of these carryforwards,  $16 million
expire in 1996,  $2.1 billion  expire at various times between 1997 and 2010 and
$173 million may be carried forward indefinitely.
     Tax benefits  associated  with exercises of stock options of $91 million in
1995, $27 million in 1994 and $23 million in 1993 were credited to shareholders'
equity.  A change in the  functional  currency of  operations in Mexico from the
U.S. dollar to local currency in 1993 resulted in a $19 million  decrease in the
net deferred foreign tax liability that was credited to shareholders' equity.

NOTE 12 - POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

PepsiCo  provides  postretirement  health  care  benefits  to  eligible  retired
employees and their  dependents,  principally  in the U.S.  Retirees who have 10
years of service and attain age 55 while in service with PepsiCo are eligible to
participate in the  postretirement  benefit plans.  The plans are not funded and
were largely noncontributory through 1993.
     Effective in 1993 and 1994, PepsiCo  implemented  programs intended to stem
rising costs and introduced retiree cost-sharing, including adopting a provision
that limits its future  obligation to absorb health care cost  inflation.  These
amendments resulted in an unrecognized prior service gain of $191 million, which
is being amortized on a straight-line  basis over the average remaining employee
service  period  of  approximately  10 years as a  reduction  in  postretirement
benefit  expense  beginning in 1993.  
     The components of  postretirement  benefit  expense for 1995, 1994 and 1993
are set forth below:

                                            1995         1994      1993

     The discount rate assumptions  used in computing the information  above are
set forth below:


                                          1995      1994      1993

      Accumulated postretirement
       benefit obligation...............   7.7%      9.1       6.8
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The year-to-year  fluctuations in the discount rate  assumptions  primarily
reflect  changes in U.S.  interest  rates.  The  discount  rate  represents  the
expected   yield  on  a  portfolio  of  high-grade   (AA  rated  or  equivalent)
fixed-income  investments  with cash flow streams  sufficient to satisfy benefit
obligations under the plans when due.
     As a result of the plan amendments discussed above, separate assumed health
care cost trend  rates are used for  employees  who retire  before and after the
effective  date of the  amendments.  The assumed health care cost trend rate for
employees  who retired  before the  effective  date is 9.0% for 1996,  declining
gradually  to 5.5% in 2005 and  thereafter.  For  employees  retiring  after the
effective  date, the trend rate is 7.5% for 1996,  declining  gradually to 0% in
2001 and  thereafter.  A 1 point  increase in the assumed health care cost trend
rate would have increased the 1995 postretirement  benefit expense by $2 million
and would have increased the 1995 accumulated  postretirement benefit obligation
by $24 million.

NOTE 13 - PENSION PLANS

PepsiCo  sponsors   noncontributory   defined  benefit  pension  plans  covering
substantially  all  full-time  U.S.   employees  as  well  as  contributory  and
noncontributory  defined  benefit pension plans covering  certain  international
employees.  Benefits generally are based on years of service and compensation or
stated amounts for each year of service. PepsiCo funds the U.S. plans in amounts
not less than minimum statutory  funding  requirements nor more than the maximum
amount that can be deducted for U.S.  

<PAGE> F-24

income tax  purposes.  International  plans are funded in amounts  sufficient to
comply with local statutory requirements.  The plans' assets consist principally
of equity  securities,  government and corporate debt securities and other fixed
income  obligations.  The U.S.  plans'  assets  included  6.9 million  shares of
PepsiCo capital stock for 1995 and 1994, with a market value of $350 million and
$227  million,  respectively.  Dividends on PepsiCo  capital stock of $5 million
were received by the U.S. plans in both 1995 and 1994.

     The assumptions used to compute the international information above are set
forth below:
                                                 1995      1994     1993

Future compensation growth rate...........     3.0%-11.8% 3.0-8.5  3.5-8.5
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The  discount  rates  and  rates  of  return  for the  international  plans
represent weighted averages.

     The year-to-year  fluctuations in the discount rate  assumptions  primarily
reflect  changes in interest  rates.  The discount rates  represent the expected
yield  on a  portfolio  of  high-grade  (AA  rated or  equivalent)  fixed-income
investments  with cash flow streams  sufficient to satisfy  benefit  obligations
under the plans when due. The lower assumed  discount  rates used to measure the
1995 projected benefit obligation compared to the assumed discount rates used to
measure the 1994  projected  benefit  obligation  changed  the funded  status of
certain plans from overfunded to underfunded.
     In 1994,  PepsiCo  changed the method for  calculating  the  market-related
value of plan assets  used in  determining  the  return-on-assets  component  of
annual pension expense and the cumulative net unrecognized  gain or loss subject
to amortization.  Under the previous  accounting  method, the calculation of the
market-related  value of assets  reflected  amortization  of the actual  capital
return on assets on a straight-line basis over a five-year period. Under the new
method,  the  calculation  of the  market-related  value of assets  reflects the
long-term rate of return expected by PepsiCo and  amortization of the difference
between the actual return  (including  capital,  dividends and interest) and the
expected  return over a five-year  period.  PepsiCo  believes  the new method is
widely used in practice  and  preferred  because it results in  calculated  plan
asset values that more closely  approximate  fair value,  while still mitigating
the effect of annual  market-value  fluctuations.  Under both methods,  only the
cumulative net unrecognized  gain or loss that exceeds 10% of the greater of the
projected  benefit  obligation  or the  market-related  value of plan  assets is
subject to  amortization.  This change  resulted in a noncash benefit in 1994 of
$38  million  ($23  million  after-tax  or $0.03  per  share)  representing  the
cumulative  effect of the change  related to years prior to 1994 and $35 million
in lower pension  expense ($22 million  after-tax or $0.03 per share) related to
1994 as compared to the previous accounting method. Had this change been applied
retroactively,  1993 pension expense would have been reduced by $16 million ($11
million after-tax or $0.01 per share).

NOTE 14 - POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN TO RETIREES

Effective  the  beginning  of  1994,  PepsiCo  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting   Standards   No.  112  (SFAS  112),   "Employers'   Accounting   for
Postemployment  Benefits."  SFAS 112  requires  PepsiCo  to  accrue  the cost of
certain  postemployment  benefits to be paid to terminated or inactive employees
other than retirees. The principal effect to PepsiCo results

<PAGE> F-29


from accruing severance benefits to be provided to employees of certain business
units who are  terminated  in the ordinary  course of business over the expected
service lives of the employees. Previously, these benefits were accrued upon the
occurrence of an event.  Severance  benefits  resulting  from actions not in the
ordinary  course of  business  will  continue to be accrued  when those  actions
occur. The cumulative  effect charge upon adoption of SFAS 112, which relates to
years prior to 1994, was $84 million ($55 million after-tax or $0.07 per share).
As compared to the previous  accounting  method,  the ongoing impact of adopting
SFAS 112 was  immaterial to 1994  operating  profits.  PepsiCo's cash flows have
been unaffected by this accounting  change as PepsiCo  continues to largely fund
postemployment benefit costs as incurred.

NOTE 15 - EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

PepsiCo grants stock options to employees pursuant to three different  incentive
plans -- the SharePower Stock Option Plan (SharePower),  the Long-Term Incentive
Plan (LTIP) and the Stock Option Incentive Plan (SOIP).  All stock option grants
are  authorized by the  Compensation  Committee of PepsiCo's  Board of Directors
(the Committee),  which is comprised of outside directors. In each case, a stock
option represents the right to purchase a share of PepsiCo capital stock (Stock)
in the future at a price equal to the fair market value of the Stock on the date
of the grant.
     Under SharePower, approved by the Board of Directors and effective in 1989,
essentially  all  employees,  other than  executive  officers and  short-service
employees,  may be granted stock options annually. The number of options granted
is based on each  employee's  annual  earnings.  The  options  generally  become
exercisable  ratably  over 5 years  from the  grant  date and must be  exercised
within 10 years of the grant date.  SharePower options of 8 million were granted
to approximately  134,000  employees in 1995; 12 million to 128,000 employees in
1994; and 9 million to 118,000 employees in 1993.
     The  shareholder-approved   1994  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  succeeds  and
continues  the principal  features of the  shareholder  approved 1987  Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the 1987 Plan). PepsiCo ceased making grants under the 1987 Plan
at the end of 1994.  Together,  these plans  comprise the LTIP. At year-end 1995
and 1994, there were 74 million and 75 million shares,  respectively,  available
for future grants under the LTIP.
     Most LTIP stock options are granted  every other year to senior  management
employees.  Most of these options become  exercisable  after 4 years and must be
exercised  within 10 years from their  grant  date.  In 1995,  1994 and 1993,  1
million,  16 million and 3 million  stock  options,  respectively,  were granted
under the LTIP.  In addition,  the LTIP allows for grants of  performance  share
units  (PSUs).  The  value of a PSU is fixed at the value of a share of Stock at
the grant  date and vests for  payment 4 years from the grant  date,  contingent
upon attainment of prescribed Corporate performance goals. PSUs are not directly
granted,  as certain stock options granted may be surrendered by employees for a
specified  number of PSUs within 60 days of the option  grant date.  At year-end
1995, 1994 and 1993, there were 599,100,  629,200 and 491,200 PSUs  outstanding,
respectively.  Payment of PSUs are made in cash and/or  Stock as approved by the
Committee.  Amounts expensed for PSUs were $5 million, $7 million and $3 million
in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
     In 1995,  the Committee  approved the 1995 Stock Option  Incentive Plan for
middle management  employees,  under which a maximum of 25 million stock options
may be granted. SOIP stock options are expected to be granted

<PAGE> F-30


annually and are exercisable  after 1 year and must be exercised within 10 years
after their grant date. In 1995, 4 million stock options were granted  resulting
in 21 million shares available for future grants at year-end.  In 1994 and 1993,
grants  similar  to those  under  the SOIP  were  made  under the LTIP to a more
limited number of middle management employees.

      Stock option activity for 1993, 1994 and 1995 is set forth below:

NOTE 16 - STOCK OFFERING BY AN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE

In 1993, PepsiCo entered into an arrangement with the principal  shareholders of
Buenos Aires  Embotelladora  S.A. (BAESA),  a franchised bottler which currently
has operations in Brazil,  Argentina,  Chile,  Uruguay and Costa Rica, to form a
joint venture. PepsiCo contributed certain assets, primarily bottling operations
in Chile and Uruguay, while the principal shareholders  contributed all of their
shares in BAESA, representing 73% of the voting control and 43% of the ownership
interest.  Through this arrangement,  PepsiCo's  beneficial  ownership in BAESA,
which  is  accounted  for  by  the  equity  method,  was  26%.  Under  PepsiCo's
partnership  agreement with the principal  shareholders of BAESA, voting control
of BAESA will be transferred to PepsiCo no later than December 31, 1999.
     On March 24, 1994,  BAESA completed a public offering of 3 million American
Depositary  Shares  (ADS) at $34.50  per ADS,  which are  traded on the New York
Stock  Exchange.  In  conjunction  with the offering,  PepsiCo and certain other
shareholders  exercised options for the equivalent of 2 million ADS. As a result
of these  transactions,  PepsiCo's  ownership  in  BAESA  declined  to 24%.  The
transactions  generated  cash proceeds for BAESA of $136 million.  The resulting
onetime, noncash gain to PepsiCo was $18 million ($17 million after-tax or $0.02
per share).

NOTE 17 - ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES

During 1995,  PepsiCo  completed  acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated
affiliates  aggregating  $475  million,   principally  for  cash.  In  addition,
approximately  $15  million  of debt was  assumed  in these  transactions.  This
activity  included  equity  investments  in  international  franchised  bottling
operations,  primarily Grupo Embotellador de Mexico, S.A. (GEMEX) in Mexico, and
in Simba,  a snack food  operation in South  Africa.  In addition,  acquisitions
included  worldwide  restaurant  operations,  primarily  in New  Zealand and the
buyout  of  a  joint  venture  partner  in  Singapore,  and  worldwide  bottling
operations.
     PepsiCo formed a joint venture with the principal  shareholder of GEMEX, an
unconsolidated  franchised bottling affiliate in Mexico.  PepsiCo acquired a 27%
interest for $207 million in cash and the contribution of a small  company-owned
bottling  operation and our interest in an existing  small  franchised  bottling
joint  venture  with  GEMEX.  In  addition,   PepsiCo   provided  the  principal
shareholder  of GEMEX a seven-year  put option which allows the  shareholder  to
sell up to 150 million  GEMEX  shares  (which  represented  about 11% of GEMEX's
outstanding  shares at the date of the  transaction)  to PepsiCo at 66 2/3 cents
per share,  which  approximated the market value at the date of the transaction.
This is equivalent to 8.3 million of GEMEX American  Depository  Receipts (ADRs)
at $12 per  ADR.  This  option  was  valued  at $26  million  at the date of the
transaction.  Under PepsiCo's agreement with the principal shareholder of GEMEX,
voting  control of GEMEX will be  transferred  to PepsiCo no later than December
31, 2002.
     During  1994,   PepsiCo   completed   acquisitions   and   investments   in
unconsolidated  affiliates  aggregating  $355 million,  principally for cash. In
addition,  approximately $41 million of debt was assumed in these  transactions,
most  of  which  was  subsequently   retired.   This  activity  included  equity
investments  in  international  franchised  bottling  operations,  primarily  in
Thailand  and China,  and  acquisitions  of  international  and U.S.  franchised
restaurant  operations  and  franchised  and  independent  bottling  operations,
primarily in India and Mexico.
     During  1993,   PepsiCo   completed   acquisitions   and   investments   in
unconsolidated  affiliates  aggregating $1.4 billion,  principally  comprised of
$1.0 billion in cash and $335 million in PepsiCo capital stock.

<PAGE> F-32

Approximately $307 million of debt was assumed in these transactions,  more than
half of which was subsequently  retired.  This activity included acquisitions of
U.S. and international franchised restaurant operations, the buyout of PepsiCo's
joint  venture  partners in a  franchised  bottling  operation  in Spain and the
related acquisition of their fruit-flavored beverage concentrate operation,  the
acquisition  of the  remaining  85%  interest  in a  large  franchised  bottling
operation  in the  Northwestern  U.S.,  the  acquisition  of Chevys,  a regional
Mexican-style casual dining restaurant chain in the U.S., and equity investments
in certain franchised bottling operations in Argentina and Mexico.
     The   acquisitions   have  been  accounted  for  by  the  purchase  method;
accordingly, their results are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
from their respective dates of acquisition. The aggregate impact of acquisitions
was not  material to  PepsiCo's  net sales,  net income or net income per share;
accordingly, no related pro forma information is provided.

NOTE 18 - CONTINGENCIES

PepsiCo  is subject to various  claims and  contingencies  related to  lawsuits,
taxes,  environmental  and other  matters  arising  out of the normal  course of
business.  Management believes that the ultimate liability, if any, in excess of
amounts  already  recognized  arising from such claims or  contingencies  is not
likely  to have a  material  adverse  effect  on  PepsiCo's  annual  results  of
operations  or  financial  condition.  At  year-end  1995 and 1994,  PepsiCo was
contingently liable under guarantees  aggregating $283 million and $187 million,
respectively.   The  guarantees  are  primarily  issued  to  support   financial
arrangements  of certain  PepsiCo joint  ventures,  and bottling and  restaurant
franchisees.  PepsiCo  manages  the risk  associated  with these  guarantees  by
performing appropriate credit reviews in addition to retaining certain rights as
a joint venture partner or franchisor. See Note 9 for information related to the
fair value of the guarantees.

NOTE 19 - BUSINESS SEGMENTS

PepsiCo operates on a worldwide basis within three industry segments: beverages,
snack foods and restaurants.

Beverages
- ---------
The beverage segment ("Beverages") markets and distributes its Pepsi-Cola,  Diet
Pepsi,  Mountain Dew and other brands  worldwide,  and 7UP,  Diet 7UP,  Mirinda,
Pepsi Max and other brands internationally.  Beverages manufactures concentrates
of its brands for sale to  franchised  bottlers  worldwide.  Beverages  operates
bottling plants and distribution  facilities  located in the U.S. and in various
international  markets for the production of company-owned and non-company-owned
brands.  Beverages also manufactures and distributes  ready-to-drink  Lipton tea
products in the U.S. and Canada.
     Beverages  products  are  available  in 193  countries  outside  the  U.S.,
including  emerging markets such as China,  Hungary,  India,  Poland and Russia.
Principal international markets include Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan,
Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Thailand, the U.K. and Venezuela.  Beverages' joint
venture ("JV") investments are primarily in franchised bottling and distribution
operations.  Internationally,  the largest JVs are GEMEX (Mexico),  BAESA (South
America)  and Serm Suk  (Thailand),  as well as the  aggregate of several JVs in
China. The primary JV in the U.S. is General Bottlers.

Snack Foods
- -----------
The snack food segment  ("Snack  Foods")  manufactures,  distributes and markets
salty and sweet snacks worldwide, with Frito-Lay representing the U.S. business.
Products  manufactured  and  distributed  in the U.S.  (primarily  salty snacks)
include  Lay's and  Ruffles  brand  potato  chips,  Doritos and  Tostitos  brand
tortilla chips, Fritos brand corn chips,  Chee.tos brand cheese flavored snacks,
Rold Gold brand pretzels,  a variety of dips and salsas and other brands.  Snack
Foods  products  are  available  in 39  countries  outside  the  U.S.  Principal
international markets include Australia,  Brazil,  Canada,  France,  Mexico, the
Netherlands,  Poland, Spain and the U.K.  International snack foods manufactures
and  distributes  salty  snacks in all  countries  and sweet  snacks in  certain
countries,  primarily in France,  Mexico and Poland. Snack Foods has investments
in several JVs outside the U.S., the largest of which are Snack Ventures  Europe
(SVE),  a JV with  General  Mills,  Inc.,  which has  operations  on most of the
European continent,  and a recent investment in Simba, a snack food operation in
South Africa.

Restaurants
- -----------
The restaurant segment  ("Restaurants") is engaged principally in the operation,
development, franchising and licensing of the worldwide Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and
KFC concepts.  Restaurants  also operates other smaller U.S.  concepts which are
managed by Taco Bell (Hot `n Now and Chevys) and Pizza Hut (East Side  Mario's).
PFS, PepsiCo's restaurant  distribution  operation,  provides food, supplies and
equipment to company-operated, franchised and licensed units, principally in the
U.S. Net sales and the related estimated operating profit of PFS' franchisee and
licensee operations have been allocated to each restaurant chain.


<PAGE> F-34


     Pizza Hut,  Taco Bell and KFC operate  throughout  the U.S.  Pizza Hut, KFC
and, to a lesser  extent,  Taco Bell  operate in 93  countries  outside the U.S.
Principal international markets include Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Mexico,
New  Zealand,  Spain and the U.K.  Restaurants  has  investments  in several JVs
outside  the U.S.,  the most  significant  of which are located in Japan and the
U.K. PepsiCo also  participates in a JV which operates  California Pizza Kitchen
(CPK), a U.S. casual dining restaurant chain.
     In 1995,  PepsiCo  changed the  presentation  of its restaurant  segment to
provide information by each of PepsiCo's major U.S. concepts,  which include the
smaller  concepts  managed  by Pizza  Hut and Taco  Bell,  and in total  for the
international  operations,  to more closely reflect how we currently  manage the
business. Prior year amounts have been restated.
     Unallocated  expenses,   net  included  corporate   headquarters  expenses,
minority  interests,  primarily in the Gamesa  (Mexico) and Wedel (Poland) snack
food businesses,  foreign exchange  translation and transaction gains and losses
and other items not allocated to the business segments.  Corporate  identifiable
assets  consist   principally  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term
investments, primarily held outside the U.S.
     PepsiCo  has  invested  in about 80 joint  ventures  in which it  exercises
significant  influence  but not control.  As noted above,  the JVs are primarily
international and principally within PepsiCo's three industry  segments.  Equity
in net (loss) income of these  unconsolidated  affiliates was ($3) million,  $38
million,  and $30 million in 1995,  1994 and 1993,  respectively.  Excluding the
initial charge upon adoption of SFAS 121 (see Accounting  Changes  below),  1995
equity in net income was $14 million.  The $24 million decline in 1995 primarily
reflected increased losses in our international  beverages affiliates in Mexico,
reflecting the  devaluation of the Mexican peso,  costs related to the formation
of the GEMEX JV and an unrealized loss on a put option issued in connection with
the  formation of the GEMEX JV (see Notes 7 and 17).  This decline was partially
offset by increased  equity in net income from our  Pepsi-Lipton Tea partnership
and SVE.  The  increase in 1994  primarily  reflected  increased  profit at SVE.
Dividends received from these unconsolidated affiliates totaled $29 million, $33
million and $16 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
     PepsiCo's  year-end  investments in unconsolidated  affiliates totaled $1.6
billion in 1995 and $1.3  billion in 1994.  The increase in 1995  reflected  the
acquisition  of a 27%  interest in GEMEX and the  investment  in Simba (see Note
17),  advances to BAESA and  investments in  international  franchised  bottling
operations in China,  partially  offset by dividends  received and equity in net
loss  that  are  discussed  above.  Significant  investments  in  unconsolidated
affiliates  at year-end 1995  included  $244 million in General  Bottlers,  $201
million in GEMEX,  $168  million in BAESA,  $157 million in a KFC Japan JV, $147
million in CPK and $107 million in SVE.

ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY

NET REFRANCHISING GAINS
Restaurant operating profit in 1995 included net gains of $51 million from sales
of  restaurants  to  franchisees  by Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and  International  in
excess of the cost of closing  other  restaurants  in all of our  concepts  (net
gains at Pizza Hut-$24 million and Taco Bell-$38 million; net losses at KFC-($7)
million and International-($4) million).

<PAGE> F-35

FISCAL YEAR
Fiscal year 1994  consisted of 53 weeks and the years 1990 through 1993 and 1995
consisted  of 52 weeks.  The  fifty-third  week  increased  1994 net sales by an
estimated $434 million, increasing beverage, snack food and restaurant net sales
by $119  million,  $143 million and $172  million,  respectively.  The estimated
impact  of the  fifty-third  week  on 1994  operating  profit  was $65  million,
increasing beverage,  snack food and restaurant operating profit by $17 million,
$26 million and $23 million,  respectively, and increasing unallocated expenses,
net by $1 million.

UNUSUAL ITEMS
Unusual  charges  totaled $193  million in 1992 and $170 million in 1991.  These
unusual items were as follows:

     Beverages  - 1992  included  $145  million  in charges  consisting  of $115
million and $30 million to  reorganize  and  streamline  U.S. and  international
operations, respectively.
     Snack  Foods  -  1992  included  a  $40  million  charge,   principally  to
consolidate  the Walkers  businesses  in the U.K.  1991 included $127 million in
charges  consisting of $91 million and $24 million to  streamline  U.S. and U.K.
operations,  respectively,  and $12 million to dispose of all or part of a small
unprofitable business in Japan.
     Restaurants  - 1991  included  $43 million in charges at KFC  primarily  to
streamline operations.
     Unallocated  expenses,  net  -  1992  included  an  $8  million  charge  to
streamline operations of the SVE joint venture.
     See  Management's  Analysis - Beverages  performance on pages 22 through 27
for additional information on the 1992 beverage restructurings.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES
PepsiCo adopted SFAS 121 as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 1995. See
Note 2. The initial, noncash charge upon adoption reduced operating profit as
follows:
                     International Beverages ................ $ 62
                     International Snack Foods .............     4

                                                              $520
                                                              ====
     (a)  Hot `n Now and Chevys  incurred  $103 of this charge,  with Hot `n Now
          responsible for almost all of the charge.
     (b)  Primarily related to CPK.

     Included in the initial charge above was $68 million related to restaurants
for which closure  decisions  were made during the fourth quarter (Pizza Hut-$21
million, Taco Bell-$16 million,  KFC-$6 million,  International-$21  million and
equity (loss) income-$4 million).  As a result of the reduced carrying amount of
certain of PepsiCo's assets used in the business,  depreciation and amortization
expense  for the fourth  quarter of 1995 was reduced by $21  million,  affecting
international 

<PAGE> F-36

beverages by $4 million,  restaurants by $16 million and equity (loss) income by
$1 million.
     In  1994,   PepsiCo   adopted  a  preferred   method  for  calculating  the
market-related  value of plan assets used in determining  annual pension expense
(see Note 13) and  extended  the  depreciable  lives on  certain  Pizza Hut U.S.
delivery assets. As compared to the previous accounting  methods,  these changes
increased 1994 operating profit by $49 million,  increasing beverage, snack food
and  restaurant  segment  operating  profit by $12 million,  $15 million and $20
million,  respectively,  and decreasing  1994  unallocated  expenses,  net by $2
million.
     In 1992, PepsiCo adopted Statements of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
106 and 109,  "Employers'  Accounting  for  Postretirement  Benefits  Other Than
Pensions" and  "Accounting for Income Taxes,"  respectively.  As compared to the
previous accounting methods,  these changes reduced 1992 operating profit by $73
million, decreasing beverage, snack food and restaurant segment operating profit
by $22 million, $31 million and $16 million,  respectively,  and increasing 1992
unallocated expenses, net by $4 million.

Management's Responsibility for Financial Statements

To Our Shareholders:

Management is  responsible  for the  reliability of the  consolidated  financial
statements  and  related  notes,  which have been  prepared in  conformity  with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and include  amounts based upon our
estimates  and  assumptions,  as required.  The financial  statements  have been
audited and reported on by our independent auditors,  KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, who
were given free access to all  financial  records and  related  data,  including
minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors  and  Committees of the Board.
We believe that management representations made to the independent auditors were
valid and appropriate.

     PepsiCo  maintains a system of internal  control over financial  reporting,
designed to provide reasonable  assurance as to the reliability of the financial
statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition.
The system is supported by formal policies and  procedures,  including an active
Code of Conduct  program  intended  to ensure  employees  adhere to the  highest
standards of personal  and  professional  integrity.  PepsiCo's  internal  audit
function  monitors  and  reports  on the  adequacy  of and  compliance  with the
internal  control  system,   and  appropriate   actions  are  taken  to  address
significant  control  deficiencies  and other  opportunities  for  improving the
system as they are  identified.  The Audit  Committee of the Board of Directors,
which is  composed  solely  of  outside  directors,  provides  oversight  to our
financial  reporting  process  and our  controls  to  safeguard  assets  through
periodic  meetings  with  our  independent   auditors,   internal  auditors  and
management. Both our independent auditors and internal auditors have free access
to the Audit Committee.

     Although no cost effective internal control system will preclude all errors
and  irregularities,  we believe our  controls as of December  30, 1995  provide
reasonable  assurance  that the financial  statements  are reliable and that our
assets are reasonably safeguarded.

Report of Independent Auditors


Board of Directors and Shareholders
PepsiCo, Inc.


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and
Subsidiaries  as of December 30, 1995 and  December  31,  1994,  and the related
consolidated  statements of income, cash flows and shareholders' equity for each
of  the  years  in  the  three-year   period  ended  December  30,  1995.  These
consolidated  financial  statements are the  responsibility  of PepsiCo,  Inc.'s
management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted  our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of PepsiCo,
Inc. and  Subsidiaries  as of December  30, 1995 and December 31, 1994,  and the
results  of its  operations  and its cash  flows  for  each of the  years in the
three-year period ended December 30, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

     As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated  financial statements,  PepsiCo,
Inc. in 1995  adopted  the  provisions  of the  Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." As
discussed in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements,  PepsiCo,
Inc. in 1994  changed its method for  calculating  the  market-related  value of
pension plan assets used in the determination of pension expense and adopted the
provisions of the Financial  Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  112,   "Employers'   Accounting  for  Postemployment
Benefits," respectively.

(a)  Included  an $18 gain ($17  after-tax  or $0.02 per share)  arising  from a
     public  share  offering by BAESA,  an  unconsolidated  franchised  bottling
     affiliate in South America. See Note 16.
(b)  Included the initial,  noncash charge of $520 ($384  after-tax or $0.48 per
     share)  upon  adoption  of SFAS  121,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  of
     Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be  Disposed  Of," at the
     beginning of the fourth quarter. As a result of the reduced carrying amount
     of  certain  long-lived  assets  to be  held  and  used  in  the  business,
     depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter was reduced by
     $21 ($15 after-tax or $0.02 per share). See Note 2.
(c)  Included a net gain of $51 ($27 after-tax or $0.03 per share), primarily in
     the fourth  quarter,  from sales of restaurants to franchisees in excess of
     the cost of closing other restaurants.
(d)  Fiscal years 1995 and 1994 consisted of 52 and 53 weeks, respectively.  The
     fifty-third week increased 1994 fourth quarter and full-year earnings by an
     estimated $54 ($35 after-tax or $0.04 per share).
(e)  Represented  the  cumulative  net effect  related to years prior to 1994 of
     adopting SFAS 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," and
     the change to a preferred method for calculating the  market-related  value
     of pension plan assets. See Notes 14 and 13, respectively.
(f)  Represented the high, low and closing prices for a share of PepsiCo capital
     stock  on the New  York  Stock  Exchange,  as  reported  by The  Dow  Jones
     News/Retrieval Service, for each respective period.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA                                  (Page 6 of 7)
(in millions except per share and employee amounts, unaudited)
PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All share and per share amounts reflect  three-for-one  stock splits in 1990 and
1986.  Additionally,  PepsiCo made numerous acquisitions in most years presented
and a few  divestitures in certain years.  Such  transactions did not materially
affect  the  comparability  of  PepsiCo's  operating  results  for  the  periods
presented,  except for certain large  acquisitions  made in 1986, 1988 and 1989,
and the divestiture discussed in (l) below.

(a)  Included the initial,  noncash charge of $520 ($384  after-tax or $0.48 per
     share)  upon  adoption  of SFAS  121,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  of
     Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be  Disposed  Of," at the
     beginning of the fourth quarter. As a result of the reduced carrying amount
     of  certain  long-lived  assets  to be  held  and  used  in  the  business,
     depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter was reduced by
     $21 ($15 after-tax or $0.02 per share). See Note 2.
(b)  Included a net gain of $51 ($27 after-tax or $0.03 per share) from sales of
     restaurants  to  franchisees  in  excess  of  the  cost  of  closing  other
     restaurants.
(c)  Included a benefit of changing to a preferred  method for  calculating  the
     market-related  value of plan  assets  in  1994,  which  reduced  full-year
     pension expense by $35 ($22 after-tax or $0.03 per share). See Note 13.
(d)  Fiscal  years 1994 and 1988 each  consisted of 53 weeks.  Normally,  fiscal
     years  consist of 52 weeks;  however,  because  the fiscal year ends on the
     last  Saturday  in  December,  a week  is  added  every 5 or 6  years.  The
     fifty-third  week  increased  1994  earnings  by  approximately   $54  ($35
     after-tax or $0.04 per share) and 1988 earnings by  approximately  $23 ($16
     after-tax or $0.02 per share).
(e)  Included  a $30  charge  ($0.04 per share) to  increase  net  deferred  tax
     liabilities as of the beginning of 1993 for a 1% statutory  income tax rate
     increase due to 1993 U.S. Federal tax legislation. See Note 11.
(f)  Included $193 in unusual charges for restructuring ($129 after-tax or $0.16
     per share). See Note 19.
(g)  Included increased postretirement benefits expense of $52 ($32 after-tax or
     $0.04 per share) as a result of adopting SFAS 106,  "Employers'  Accounting
     for  Postretirement  Benefits Other Than Pensions."  Included the impact of
     adopting SFAS 109,  "Accounting  for Income  Taxes,"  which reduced  pretax
     income by $21 and the provision for income taxes by $34.
(h)  Included $170 in unusual charges ($120  after-tax or $0.15 per share).  See
     Note 19.
(i)  Included  $83 in unusual  charges  ($49  after-tax  or $0.06 per share) for
     costs of closing restaurants, U.S. trade receivables exposures, accelerated
     contributions  to the PepsiCo  Foundation  and a reduction  in the carrying
     amount of an unconsolidated international Pizza Hut affiliate.
(j)  The $18 gain ($17 after-tax or $0.02 per share) in 1994 arose from a public
     share offering by BAESA, an unconsolidated franchised bottling affiliate in
     South  America.  See Note 16.  The $118  gain ($53  after-tax  or $0.07 per
     share) in 1990 arose from an initial  public  offering  of new shares by an
     unconsolidated  KFC  joint  venture  in Japan  and a sale by  PepsiCo  of a
     portion of its shares.

PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(k)  Represented the cumulative effect of adopting in 1994 SFAS 112, "Employers'
     Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," and changing to a preferred method
     for calculating the market-related value of plan assets used in determining
     the return-on-asset  component of annual pension expense and the cumulative
     net unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization (see Notes 14 and 13,
     respectively)  and adopting in 1992 SFAS 106 ($575 ($357 after-tax or $0.44
     per share)) and SFAS 109 ($571 tax charge  ($0.71 per share)).  Prior years
     were not restated for these changes in accounting.
(l)  Included impacts of discontinued operations,  the most significant of which
     were in 1985,  which included  income of $124  after-tax  ($0.15 per share)
     resulting from PepsiCo  disposing of its sporting goods and  transportation
     segments.
(m)  Cash flows from other  investing  and financing  activities,  which are not
     presented, are an integral part of total cash flow activity.
(n)  See Net Income Per Share in Note 1.
(o)  Total debt includes  short-term  borrowings and long-term  debt,  which for
     1987 through 1990 included a nonrecourse obligation.
(p)  The return on average  shareholders' equity is calculated using income from
     continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting changes.
(q)  The market net debt ratio represents net debt as a percent of net debt plus
     the market value of equity,  based on the year-end stock price. Net debt is
     total debt,  which for this purpose includes the present value of long-term
     operating  lease  commitments,  reduced  by the  pro  forma  remittance  of
     investment  portfolios  held outside the U.S. For 1987 through 1990,  total
     debt was also reduced by the  nonrecourse  obligation in the calculation of
     net debt.
(r)  The historical cost net debt ratio represents net debt (see (q) above) as a
     percent of capital employed (net debt, other  liabilities,  deferred income
     taxes and shareholders' equity).

     Section 2.5 QUORUM,  PRESIDING OFFICER.  Except as otherwise  prescribed by

stockholders  of the  Corporation,  the  presence  in  person or by proxy of the

stock of the Corporation  entitled to vote thereat shall constitute a quorum for
the  transaction of business.  In the absence of a quorum at such meeting or any
adjournment or adjournments thereof, the holders of record of a majority of such
shares so present in person or by proxy and  entitled to vote thereat or, in the
absence of all the  stockholders,  any officer  entitled to preside at or act as
Secretary  of the  meeting,  may adjourn  the meeting  from time to time until a
quorum  shall be  present.  At any such  adjourned  meeting at which a quorum is
present,  any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the
meeting as originally  called.  Meetings of the  stockholders  shall be presided
over by the Chairman or Vice  Chairman of the Board,  or, if neither is present,
by another officer or director who shall be designated to serve in such event by
the  Board.  The  Secretary  of  the  Corporation,  or  an  Assistant  Secretary

the meeting.

     Section 2.6 VOTING,  INSPECTORS OF ELECTION. Except as otherwise prescribed
by statute,  the Articles of Incorporation  or these By-Laws,  at any meeting of

Corporation  registered  in the  name of such  stockholder  on the  books of the
Corporation  on the date fixed  pursuant to Section 8.3 of these  By-Laws as the
record  date for the  determination  of  stockholders  entitled  to vote at such
meeting.  No proxy shall be voted after  eleven (11) months from its date unless
said  proxy  provides  for a longer  period.  Shares  of its own  capital  stock
belonging to the  Corporation  shall not be voted either directly or indirectly.
At all meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation,  a quorum being present,
all matters (except as otherwise expressly  prescribed by statute,  the Articles
of  Incorporation  or these By-Laws) shall be decided by the vote of the holders
of a majority  of the stock of the  Corporation,  present in person or by proxy,
and  entitled to vote  thereat.  The vote for the election of  directors,  other
matters  expressly  prescribed  by  statute,  and,  upon  the  direction  of the

inspectors of election,  together with one  alternate,  to serve in the event of
death,  inability or refusal by any of said  inspectors  of election to serve at
the meeting,  none of whom need be a stockholder  of the  Corporation,  shall be
appointed by the Board,  or, if no such  appointment or appointments  shall have
been made, then by the presiding officer at the meeting. If, for any reason, any
inspector of election so appointed shall fail to attend,  or refuse or be unable
to serve, a substitute shall be appointed to serve as inspector of election,  in
his place or stead,  by the  presiding  officer at the  meeting.  No director or
candidate for the office of director  shall be appointed as an  inspector.  Each
inspector shall take and subscribe an oath or affirmation to execute  faithfully
the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict  impartiality  and according
to the best of his ability.  After the balloting,  the  inspectors  shall make a
certificate of the result of the vote taken.

     Section 2.7 LISTS OF  STOCKHOLDERS.  It shall be the duty of the officer of
the  Corporation  who shall have charge of the stock ledger of the  Corporation,
either  directly  or  through  another  officer  designated  by him or through a
transfer agent or transfer clerk appointed by the Board, to prepare and make, at
least ten (10) days before  every  election  of  directors,  a complete  list of
stockholders entitled to vote at said election,  arranged in alphabetical order.
Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder at the place where
said  election is to be held for said ten (10) days,  and shall be produced  and
kept at the time and place of election,  during the whole time thereof,  subject
to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present.


                                   ARTICLE III

                               Board of Directors

     Section 3.1 POWERS,  NUMBER,  TERM,  ELECTION.  The property,  business and
affairs  of the  Corporation  shall be managed  by the  Board.  The Board  shall
consist of fifteen (15) directors, but the number of directors may be increased,
and may be  decreased  to any  number not less than  three  (3),  by  resolution
adopted by three-fourths of the whole Board; provided,  however, that the number
of directors  which shall  constitute  the whole Board shall not be reduced to a
number less than the number of directors  then in office,  unless such reduction
shall  become   effective  only  at  and  after  the  next  ensuing  meeting  of
stockholders  for the  election  of  directors,  or upon the  resignation  of an
incumbent  director.  At all meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for
the election of directors at which a quorum shall be present,  a majority of the
votes cast shall  elect.  Each  director  shall hold office from the time of his
election  and  qualification  until the  annual  meeting  of  stockholders  next
succeeding his election and until his successor shall have been duly elected and
shall have qualified,  or until his death,  resignation or removal.  No director
need be a stockholder.

     Section  3.2 PLACE OF  MEETINGS.  The Board may hold its  meetings  at such
place or places  within or without  the State of North  Carolina  as it may from
time to time by resolution  determine,  or as shall be specified or fixed in the
respective notices or waivers 

<PAGE>4

of notice  thereof.  Any regular or special  meeting  may be held by  conference
telephone   or  similar   communications   equipment  so  long  as  all  persons
participating in such meeting can hear one another,  and participation in such a
telephonic meeting shall constitute presence in person.

     Section 3.3 FIRST MEETING. After each annual election of directors,  on the
same day and at the place where such  election is held,  the newly elected Board
shall meet for the purpose of  organization,  the  election of officers  and the
transaction of other  business.  Notice of such meeting need not be given.  Such
meeting  may be held at any other time or place which  shall be  specified  in a
notice given as hereinafter  provided for special meetings of the Board, or in a
waiver of notice thereof signed by all the directors.

     Section 3.4 REGULAR MEETINGS.  Regular meetings of the Board may be held at
such  time and  place  and in such  manner as the Board may from time to time by
resolution  determine.  Except as otherwise expressly prescribed by statute, the
Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws,  notice of regular meetings need not
be given.

     Section 3.5 SPECIAL  MEETINGS.  Special meetings of the Board shall be held
whenever called by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board,  the President or
by the Secretary  upon the written  request filed with the Secretary by any four
(4) directors. Notice of the time, place and manner of each such special meeting
shall be mailed to each  director,  at his residence or usual place of business,
not later than the  second  day  before  the day on which such  meeting is to be
held,  or shall be sent  addressed  to him at such place by  telegraph  or other
electronic  transmission,  or shall be delivered personally or by telephone, not
later than six o'clock in the  afternoon of the day before the day on which such
meeting is to be held. Except as otherwise  prescribed by statute,  the Articles
of Incorporation  or these By-Laws,  and except in the case of a special meeting
of the Board  called for the  purpose of  removing an officer or officers of the
Corporation or the filling of a vacancy or vacancies in the Board or of amending
the  By-Laws,  notice or waivers of notice of any  meeting of the Board need not
set forth the purpose or purposes of the meeting.

     Section 3.6 QUORUM.  Except as otherwise  prescribed by statute or by these
By-Laws,  the presence of a majority of the full Board shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business at any meeting, and the act of a majority of the
directors  present at a meeting at which a quorum shall be present  shall be the
act of the Board.  Any meeting of the Board may be adjourned by a majority  vote
of the  directors  present at such  meeting.  In the  absence  of a quorum,  the
Chairman or Vice  Chairman of the Board or a majority of the  directors  present
may  adjourn  such  meeting  until a quorum  shall  be  present.  Notice  of any
adjourned meeting need not be given. The directors shall act only as a board and
the individual directors shall have no power as such.

     Section 3.7 INDEMNIFICATION.  Unless the Board of Directors shall determine
otherwise, the Corporation shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law,
any person who was or is, or who is threatened to be made, a party to an action,
suit or 

<PAGE> 5 



proceeding, whether civil, criminal,  administrative or investigative, by reason
of the fact that he, his testator or intestate, is or was a director, officer or
employee  of  the  Corporation,  or is or was  serving  at  the  request  of the
Corporation as a director,  officer or employee of another  enterprise,  against
expenses  (including  attorneys'  fees),  judgments,  fines and amounts  paid in
settlement  actually  and  reasonably  incurred by him in  connection  with such
action, suit or proceeding.  Such  indemnification may, in the discretion of the
Board, include advances of a director's,  officer's or employee's expenses prior
to  final  disposition  of  such  action,  suit  or  proceeding.  The  right  of
indemnification provided for in this Section 3.7 shall not exclude any rights to
which such persons may otherwise be entitled by contract or as a matter of law.

     Section 3.8 WRITTEN CONSENTS.  Any action required or permitted to be taken
at any meeting of the Board or of any  committee  thereof may be taken without a
meeting,  if, prior to such action,  a written  consent thereto is signed by all
members of the Board or of such committee,  as the case may be, and such written

            of  Service  following  his  rehire  (determined  under  the
            preceding   provisions   of  this   subsection   as  if  his
            employment  first  commenced  on  his  date  of  rehire).  A
            "break in  service"  is a 12-month  period  beginning  on an
            Employee's  Severance  from  Service  Date during  which the
            Employee is not credited with an Hour of Service.
            2.2   Construction:   The  terms  of  this  Plan   shall  be
  construed in accordance with this section.
                  (a) Gender and Number:  The  masculine  gender,  where
      appearing  in the Plan,  shall be deemed to include  the  feminine
      gender and the  singular  shall  include  the  plural,  unless the
      context clearly indicates to the contrary.
                  (b)   Headings:   The   headings   of   sections   and
      subsections  are for  ease of  reference  only  and  shall  not be
      construed to limit or modify the detailed provisions thereof.

                   Contributions and Deferral Amounts


           4.1 Elective  Deferrals:  An Employee  who is eligible  under
Section  3.1 and who has  Eligible  Pay may elect to defer a portion  of
his Eligible Pay in accordance with the following subsections.
           (a)   Deferral    Amount:    Subject   to   the   limitations
     established by this Article,  each Active  Participant may defer in
     any Plan Year up to 10 percent (15  percent,  effective  January 1,
     1996) of his Eligible Pay in accordance  with this section.  In the
     event a  Participant  elects to defer a portion of his Eligible Pay
     under the  Plan,  it will be  designated  for  contribution  by the
     Employer  to the  Trust  on  behalf  of the  Participant,  and  for
     deposit in his Salary Deferral  Account.  All amounts  deposited to
     a  Participant's  Salary  Deferral  Account  shall at all  times be
     fully vested.
           (b)  Election to Defer:  Each  Employee  who  qualifies as an
     eligible  Employee  under  Section 3.1 may elect to defer a portion
     of  his  Eligible  Pay  in  accordance   with  subsection  (d).  An
     eligible Employee shall make this election by:
                     (1) Completing  and returning the enrollment  form,
            or utilizing the telephone  enrollment  system,  provided by
            the Plan Administrator,
                     (2)  Designating  a portion of his  Eligible Pay to
            be contributed by his Employer to the Plan, and
                     (3)   Indicating   how  such   amounts  are  to  be
            invested under Section 5.2.
     An eligible  Employee's  election  under this  subsection  shall be
     effective as soon as practicable  for his Employer and shall remain
     in effect until it is modified or terminated  under  subsection (c)
     below, or until his active  participation  terminates in accordance
     with Section 3.2(b).
           (c)  Changes in  Deferral  Election:  Subject  to  subsection
     (d),  an Active  Participant  may elect to  increase,  decrease  or
     terminate the amount of his deferral at any


                                    

<PAGE> IV-2


     time by  completing  and  returning a change of election  form,  or
     using the  telephone  enrollment  system to  designate  the revised
     deferral  rate  to be  contributed  to the  Plan.  A  Participant's
     election  under  this  subsection  shall  be  effective  as soon as
     practicable for his Employer.
           (d) Election  Procedures:  To be effective,  an election made
     pursuant to subsection  (b) or (c) above must be made in the manner
     specified  by the Plan  Administrator.  In  addition,  the election
     shall  specify  the amount of the  deferral  desired  for each Plan
     Year  in the  form  of a  whole  dollar  amount,  a  percentage  of
     Eligible Pay, or a combination  of the two as specified by the Plan
     Administrator  from time to time (effective prior to 1996, only the
     whole  dollar  amount  form  shall be  available),  subject  to the
     limitation  in  subsection  (a) above.  Any election  purporting to
     defer more than the maximum  percentage  of Eligible Pay  permitted
     under  subsection (a) shall be treated as an election to defer such
     maximum percentage of Eligible Pay.  Notwithstanding  the preceding
     sentence,   the  Plan  Administrator   shall  not  give  effect  to
     elections that do not meet the minimum  standards for  completeness
     and accuracy the Plan Administrator establishes from time to time.
           (e)  Payroll  Deductions:  A  Participant's  Salary  Deferral
     Contributions  shall be  withheld  from his  Eligible  Pay  through
     automatic  payroll  deductions.  The amount to be  withheld  in any
     pay period shall be a ratable share of the Participant's  currently
     effective  salary  deferral  election  for the  entire  Plan  Year.
     Salary Deferral  Contributions  may not be withheld after they have
     been actually or constructively received by the Participant.
         4.2  Dollar  Limits  on  Elective  Deferrals:   Notwithstanding
Section  4.1, a  Participant's  Elective  Deferrals  shall be limited as
provided in this section.
           (a) Initial  Limit:  Effective for calendar  years  beginning
     on and after January 1, 1987, a  Participant's  Elective  Deferrals
     under the Plan  shall be  limited  to $7,000  or, if  greater,  the
     adjusted  amount  in  effect  under  Code  section  402(g)  for the
     preceding calendar year.
           (b)  Additional  Limit:  Effective  for Plan Years  beginning
     after 1987, a Participant's  Elective Deferrals,  which are made in
     any calendar year to the Plan or any

            performance.  Investments  in  this  investment  option  are
            subject  to  fluctuations,  and  there  is no  guarantee  of
            future performance.  The Participant's  interest in the Fund
            will be  denominated  as  "units."  The  value  of a unit in
            this Fund will  fluctuate  based on the  performance  of the
            Fund.  The number of units  credited to a  Participant  will
            not fluctuate based upon the performance of the Fund.
                     (3)   The   Equity-Income   Fund:   This   Fund  is
            primarily  invested  in  the  Fidelity  Equity-Income  Fund,
            which  invests  primarily  in  income-reducing  stocks.  The
            Fund's  chief  objective  is to provide  reasonable  income,
            although   some    consideration   is   given   to   capital
            appreciation.  Amounts  invested in this  investment  option
            are subject to  fluctuations,  and there is no  guarantee of
            future performance.  The Participant's  interest in the Fund
            will be  denominated  as  "units."  The  value  of a unit in
            this Fund will  fluctuate  based on the  performance  of the
            Fund.  the number of units  credited to a  Participant  will
            not fluctuate based upon the performance of the Fund.
                  (4) The PepsiCo  Capital Stock Fund:  This  investment
            option is  invested  primarily  in Company  Stock.  Earnings
            will be applied  primarily  to the  purchase  of  additional
            share of  Company  Stock.  The  objective  of the Fund is to
            parallel     the     total      return      (stock     price
            appreciation/depreciation   plus   dividends)   of   Company
            Stock.  Amounts  invested  in  this  investment  option  are
            subject  to  fluctuations  and  there  is not  guarantee  of
            future performance.
            A Participant's  interest in the Fund will be denominated as
            "units."  The initial  value of a unit (as of  February  29,
            1992) in this Fund is $10.00 and  thereafter  the value of a
            unit  will   fluctuate   in  response  to  various   factors
            including,  but not limited  to, the price of and  dividends
            paid  on  Company  Stock,   earnings  and  losses  on  other
            investments  in the Fund,  the mix of assets in the Fund and
            Fund   expenses.   The  number  of  units   credited   to  a
            Participant's  account  will not  fluctuate  based  upon the
            performance  of the Fund.  Shares of PepsiCo  Capital  Stock
            held in the Fund and dividends and other


<PAGE> V-4

            distributions  on PepsiCo Capital Stock are not specifically
            allocated  to  Participant   accounts.   Each  Participant's
            investment  in the PepsiCo  Capital Stock Fund will be based
            on the  proportion  of his  investment  in the  Fund  to the
            total investment in the Fund of all Plan Participants.
                       All  dividends on shares of Company  Stock in the
            Fund are paid to the Fund.  Dividends  on these  shares  are
            added to the Fund without the purchase of  additional  units
            in the Fund.  The Trustee  shall use the dividend  income to
            purchase  additional  share of Company Stock for the Fund or
            to meet the cash  demands  of the Fund.  Any  Company  Stock
            received by the Trustee as a stock split or dividend,  or as
            a result of a reorganization  or other  recapitalization  of
            PepsiCo,  will be  added  to the  assets  of the  Fund.  Any
            other   property   (other  than  shares  of  Company  Stock)
            received  by the  Trustee may be sold by the Trustee and the
            proceeds  added to the  fund.  Any  rights to  subscribe  to
            additional  shares  of  Company  Stock  shall be sold by the
            Trustee and the proceeds credited to the Fund.
                       Participants  who have  invested  in the Fund may
            direct the Trustee how to vote (or  tender,  if  applicable)
            Company    Stock.    The   Trustee   will   determine   each
            Participant's  proportional  share of the  Company  Stock in
            the Fund  (based  on the  number of units  allocated  to the
            Participant's   Accounts)  and  solicit  the   Participant's
            instructions.  The Trustee  shall vote (and/or  tender) this
            stock  according  to  the  Participant's   directions.   The
            Trustee  shall not vote  stock in the Fund for which it does
            not receive directions
                       The   Company   shall   assist  the   Trustee  in
            furnishing  Participants  investing  in the PepsiCo  Capital
            Stock Fund with proxy  materials,  notices  and  information
            statements  at the time voting  rights are to be  exercised.
            In  general,  the  materials  to be  furnished  Participants
            shall be the same as those provided to security holders.

                       Shares of  Company  Stock will be  purchased  for
            the  Fund in the  open  market  or in  privately  negotiated
            transactions,  at prices  not in  excess of the fair  market
            value of the Company  Stock on the date of  purchase.  Sales
            of  shares  will  also  be  made in the  open  market  or in
            privately  negotiated  transactions at prices not lower than
            the  fair  market  value  of  Company  Stock  on the date of
            sale. The Trustee,  or its designated  agent,  may limit the
            daily  volume  of  purchases  and  sales  to the  extent  it
            believes it will be in the  interest of  Participants  to do
            so.
                        (5)  The Brokerage Option:

                  investment   option  will  be  administered  by  State
                  Street  Band and the agents it  employs as  securities
                  brokers to execute  Participants'  trades. This option
                  permits  certain  Participants  and  Beneficiaries  to

                  The Plan  Administrator  shall  publish  written rules
                  and  procedures  for the election of these  additional
                  choices by  Participants  and  Beneficiaries,  and may
                  revise such rules and  procedures  at any time and for
                  any reason.  The investments  expected to be available

                        York or  American  Stock  Exchange or the NASDAQ
                        exchange).
                                    (B)    The     following     trading

                  participates  in the  Brokerage  Option shall have his

                  commissions   and  fees  (including  fees  charged  on
                  account of one or more  investments  in a mutual fund)
                  payable  on their  individual  transactions  and shall
                  also  have  his  interest  in the Plan  reduced  by an
                  access  fee  (initially  $4.20) for each month or part
                  thereof  that  the  Participant  participates  in  the

                  sell   securities   or  other  assets  held  within  a
                  Participant's  Account  for the  purpose of paying the
                  commissions  and fees  described  in this  subsection.
                  Investment in the  Brokerage  Option is subject to the
                  following restrictions:
                                    (A)  To  commence   investing  under
                        this  program,  the  Participant  must  first be
                        eligible to enroll in the  Brokerage  Option.  A
                        Participant  is  eligible to enroll if he has at

                        Administrator  or its  agent;  and  his  initial
                        transfer  election into the Brokerage  Option is
                        at least  $1,000.  Subsequent  transfers  to and
                        from the Brokerage  Option must be at least $250
                        unless   such   transfer   is   to   close   the
                        Participant's   account   under  the   Brokerage
                        Option.  All transfers to the  Brokerage  Option
                        must be from prior savings.
                                    (B) No  amounts  invested  either in
                        the  Security  Plus  Fund  or in the  Guaranteed
                        Income Fund may be directly  transferred  to the
                        Brokerage   Option,   and  no  amounts  invested
                        either  in  the  Security  Plus  Fund  or in the

                        transferred  to the Brokerage  Option,  i.e., by
                        first  transferring  the  amounts  to some other
                        investment  fund  (or  funds)  under  the  Plan,
                        unless  such  amounts  remain  invested  in  the
                        intervening  fund  (or  funds)  for at  least  3
                        months.
                                    (C) Except as  provided  in the last
                        sentence  of this  clause  (C),  no  security or
                        investment  held  by  a  Participant's   account
                        within the Brokerage  Option may be  transferred
                        or  distributed  directly  to  the  Participant.
                        The   Participant   must   initially   sell  the
                        security or  investment.  The Trustee will place
                        the  proceeds  of  such  sale  in  a  short-term
                        investment  fund,  designed  to generate a money
                        market  rate of  return,  within  the  Brokerage
                        Option.   The  proceeds   will  remain  in  such
                        account  until  the  Participant  instructs  the
                        Plan  Administrator or its agent to transfer all
                        or a portion of such  proceeds  into one or more
                        of the other separate  investment options within
                        the  Trust  Fund  provided  that the  investment
                        option   chosen  by  the   Participant   permits
                        contributions.   The   crediting   of   earnings
                        within the  short-term  investment  fund and the
                        transfer of funds to other



<PAGE> V-8




                        investment  funds  within  the Trust Fund may be
                        delayed  until after the  settlement  period for
                        the class of security  sold by the  Participant,
                        ranging   from  one  to  five   business   days.
                        In-kind   distributions  are  permitted  in  the
                        event   of   a   complete   distribution   of  a
                        Participant's   interest  as   specified   under
                        Section 6.1 or 6.2.
                        (6) The  Guaranteed  Income  Fund:  This fund is
            established  through  contractual  arrangements  with one or
            more insurance  companies or other  financial  institutions.
            Effective  January 1, 1992,  the  Guaranteed  Income Fund no
            longer accepts additional  deposits.  As of January 1, 1992,
            two 1991 Guaranteed  Income Funds contracts,  both issued by
            Metropolitan  Life,  were  transferred  to the Security Plus
            Fund.  The return on amounts  that  remain  invested  in the
            Guaranteed  Income Fund is determined in accordance with the
            contract (or contracts)  applicable to the year in which the
            amounts  were   invested.   Guarantees   of  principal   and
            interest are  provided  solely by the  insurance  company or
            other  financial  institution  issuing  the  contract.   The
            transfer of funds invested in the Guaranteed  Income Fund to
            other separate  investment  funds within the Trust Fund will
            be restricted in the following manner:
                             (i) No amounts  invested in the  Guaranteed
                  Income Fund for any Plan Year may be  transferred by a
                  Participant  directly  into the Security  Plus Fund or
                  the  Brokerage  Option.  No  amounts  invested  in the
                  Guaranteed  Income  Fund  for  any  Plan  Year  may be
                  transferred   by  a  Participant   indirectly  to  the
                  Security Plus Fund or the Brokerage  Option,  i.e., by
                  first   transferring   the   amounts   to  some  other
                  investment  fund (or  funds)  under the  Plan,  unless
                  such amounts remain invested in the  intervening  fund
                  (or funds) for at least 3 months; and



<PAGE> V-9


                              (ii) A  Participant  can transfer  amounts
                  from  the  Guaranteed  Income  Fund  into  some  other
                  investment  fund  (or  funds)  under  the Plan no more
                  than 12 times during the Plan Year.
                 (b)     Maintaining     Liquidity:      Notwithstanding
     subsection  (a) above,  for the purpose of  providing  liquidity in
     each of the separate  investment  options (other than the Brokerage
     Option)  under the Plan,  the  Trustee may invest a portion of each
     fund or  investment  option  under  the Plan in cash or  short-term
     securities.  The  percentage  of assets  held for this  purpose  is
     normally   expected   to  range  from  2-10   percent,   but  under
     extraordinary  circumstances  the percentages may be  substantially
     higher.  Consequently,  the  mix  of  cash,  securities  and  other
     investments   in  each  of  the   investment   funds   could   vary
     significantly  at  any  given  time  and  the  performance  of  any
     particular  fund  may not  match  the  performance  of the  fund or
     stock,  as the case  may be,  outside  the  Plan.  In the  unlikely
     event  that the  amount of  liquid  assets  held by these  funds is
     insufficient  to satisfy the immediate  demand for liquidity  under
     the   Plan,   the   Trustee,   in   consultation   with   the  Plan
     Administrator,  may temporarily  limit or suspend  transfers of any
     type  (including  withdrawals  and  distribution)  to or  from  the
     investment  options  specified in subsection (a). In any such case,
     the  Plan   Administrator   shall  temporarily  change  the  Plan's
     Valuation  Date or, in its  discretion,  the  Valuation  Date for a
     specific   option.   During  this  period,   contributions  to  any
     affected option may be redirected to substitute  investments chosen
     by the Trustee.
                 (c)   Procedures   for   Investment    Directions:    A
     Participant  may direct the  investment of the amounts  credited to
     him  under  the  Plan  into the  investment  options  described  in
     subsection  (a)  only  in  accordance  with  this   subsection.   A
     Participant  shall direct the  investment,  or change the direction
     of  the  investment,  of  his  future  or  existing  investment  by
     directing the Plan Administrator  through the telephone  enrollment
     system  provided  by the Plan  Administrator  for such  purpose (or
     through any other method made available by the Plan  Administrator)
     and   by   specifying   whether   the   Participant's    investment
     instructions  apply to existing  savings,  future  contributions or
     both.


 
<PAGE> V-10


                         (1)   The    Participant    will    have   sole
            responsibility  for the  investment  of his  savings and for
            transfers  among  the  available  investment  funds,  and no
            named  fiduciary or other person will have any liability for
            any  loss  or  diminution  in  value   resulting   from  the
            Participant's  exercise of such  investment  responsibility.
            In addition,  because Participants control the investment of
            Participant Accounts,  the Plan is intended to be covered to
            the maximum  extent  possible by section 404(c) of ERISA and
            related Department of Labor regulations,  which provide that
            Plan  fiduciaries  may be  relieved  of  liability  for  any
            losses that are the result of investment  instructions given
            by a Participant or Beneficiary.
                        (2) In the  case of an  option  other  than  the
            Brokerage Option, a Participant's  investment instruction or
            change in  investment  instruction  shall take  effect as of
            the end of the  day on  which  the  Participant  gives  such
            instruction  or  change  to the Plan  Administrator  (or its
            agent),  provided the Participant  executes such instruction
            or change by 3:00 p.m.  (Eastern  time) on a  business  day.
            If the  Participant  executes his instruction or change on a
            Saturday,  Sunday, holiday or after 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time)
            on a business  day, such  instruction  or change will become
            effective on the next following business day.
                        (3)  In the  case  of the  Brokerage  Option,  a
            Participant's  investment  instruction  or change within the
            Brokerage  Option  or  fund  transfers  into  the  Brokerage
            Option  shall be  effective  in  accordance  with  rules set
            forth by the Plan  Administrator  consistent  with the rules
            that  govern  the  exchange  or fund ion which  Participants
            invest.
     Any investment  direction  submitted by a Participant must specify,
     in whole  percentages (1 to 100), the percentage of his accounts to
     be  invested  in  any  or all  of  the  separate  investment  funds
     maintained  under  the  Plan.  If a  Participant  fails to submit a
     statement of direction  properly  directing  the  investment of 100
     percent of his  accounts,  and such failure is not  corrected,  the
     Participant shall not be eligible to participate actively, or to

  
<PAGE> V-11


     continue to participate actively,  in the Plan; provided,  however,
     that amounts  previously  invested  pursuant to a properly executed
     statement  of  investment   direction   shall  continue  to  remain
     invested in the Fund or Funds so elected.  The rules for  transfers
     set forth in  paragraphs  (2) and (3) above are subject to the last
     3 sentences of subsection (b) above.
                 (d)  Miscellaneous:
                       (1) It is expressly  permissible  under this Plan
           for  Trust  assets  to be  invested  in  qualifying  employer
           securities,  as that term is defined in section  407(d)(5) of
           ERISA,  up to and  including  100  percent of the total Trust
           assets.  If  Company  Stock is  purchased  other  than on the
           open market,  the Company Stock shall be valued in good faith
           and  based  on all  relevant  factors,  including  the  sales
           prices  of such  stock,  as  reported  on the New York  Stock
           Exchange, on the date of purchase.
                       (2)   The   separate    investment   funds   made
           available  under the Trust Fund and their rules of  operation
           and  valuation  may be changed from time to time by agreement
           between the Company and the Trustee.
                       (3) As of each  Valuation  Date, the Trustee will
           determine  the  fair  market  value  of the  assets  in  each
           separate  investment  fund of the Trust  Fund,  relying  upon
           such evidence of valuation as the Trustee deems appropriate.
           5.3  Adjusting   Account   Balances:   As  of  the  close  of
business on each  Valuation  Date (before  adjusting for  contributions,
distributions and investment  transfers),  Participants'  Accounts shall
be charged or credited with:
                     (a)  Investment Expenses,
                     (b)  Investment income, and
                     (c) Gains and  losses in asset  values,  which have
      occurred with respect to each  separate  option (and each separate
      investment  within  the  Brokerage  Option)  since  the  preceding
      Valuation Date.  Thereafter,  the final Account balances as of the
      Valuation  Date  will  be  determined  by  adjusting  the  amounts
      determined under the

                                         


<PAGE> V-12


      preceding   sentence   for   contributions,    distributions   and
      investment  transfers.  The allocation of Investment  Expenses and
      investment  results as of a Valuation  Date shall be in proportion
      to the final Account  balances in the fund or investment as of the
      preceding  Valuation  Date.  Gains and losses in assets  values as
      of a Valuation  Date shall be determined in accordance  with rules
      of the Plan  Administrator  and may not reflect the closing values
      of the assets on such Valuation Date.


<PAGE> VII-3


The value of the  Participant's  account  balance and  investment in the
Core  Funds  shall be based on the  market  values of such  items at the
time of the Participant's  Telephone  Application or the issuance of the
loan, whichever is less.
            7.4  Maximum Number of Outstanding Loans and Refinancing:
                  (a) A  Participant  shall  not have more than one loan
      outstanding  from  the Plan at any  time.  Subject  to  subsection
      (b), no loan may be made to a  Participant  until the repayment of
      any previous loan to such Participant.
                  (b) A Participant  with an  outstanding  loan from the
      Plan is  eligible to apply for a  refinanced  loan,  provided  the
      refinanced  loan  is  issued  at  least  two  years  (six  months,
      effective  as soon as  practicable  after  October 20, 1995) after
      issuance of the  outstanding  loan. A  refinanced  loan shall meet
      all the  requirements  for a loan set forth in this  Article  VII.
      Its  proceeds  shall  first be applied to repay the balance of the
      outstanding  loan,  with any remainder  payable to the Participant
      as cash.  The interest  rate,  fees,  term and repayment  schedule
      applicable  to a  refinanced  loan  shall  be  determined  without
      reference to the original loan.
            7.5  Effect  on  Participant's   Investment:  A  loan  shall
constitute  a  segregated  investment  solely  of  the  Account  of  the
borrowing Participant.
                  (a) When  initially  made, a loan shall be funded from
      the borrowing Participant's Core Fund investments,  prorated based
      on the Participant's balance in each Core Fund.
                  (b) All  repayments of principal and related  interest
      and any  gains  and  losses  on a loan  shall be  credited  to the
      borrowing   Participant's   account.   Loan  repayments  shall  be
      invested in accordance with the Participant's  current  investment
      direction for Salary  Deferral  Contributions.  If the Participant
      does not have an  investment  direction  in  effect on the date of
      the Participant's  Loan Application,  the Participant must provide
      an investment

            9.1 Allocation of  Responsibility  Among  Fiduciaries for Plan
and Trust  Administration:  The Fiduciaries  shall have only those specific
powers,  duties,  responsibilities,  and  obligations  as are  specifically
given   them   under   this  Plan  or  the  Trust   instrument.   The  Plan
Administrator  shall have the sole  responsibility  for the  administration
of the Plan, which  responsibility  is specifically  described in this Plan
and the Trust  instrument,  except  where an agent is  appointed to perform
administrative  duties as specifically  agreed to by the Plan Administrator
and the agent.  Subject to Section  5.2(c)(1),  the Trustee  shall have the
sole   responsibility   for  the   administration  of  the  Trust  and  the
management of the assets held under the Trust as  specifically  provided in
the  Trust  instrument,   except  where  an  investment  manager  has  been
appointed  or  as  provided   otherwise  in  the  Trust  instrument.   Each
Fiduciary  warrants that any directions given,  information  furnished,  or
action taken by it shall be in accordance  with the  provisions of the Plan
or the Trust instrument,  as the case may be,  authorizing or providing for
such  direction,  information  or action.  Furthermore,  each Fiduciary may
rely upon any  direction,  information  or action of another  Fiduciary  as
being proper under this Plan or the Trust,  and is not required  under this
Plan  or  the  Trust  instrument  to  inquire  into  the  propriety  of any
direction,  information  or action of  another  Fiduciary  as being  proper
under this Plan or the Trust,  and is not  required  under this Plan or the
Trust   instrument  to  inquire  into  the  propriety  of  any   direction,
information  or  action.  It is  intended  under  this  Plan and the  Trust
instrument  that  each  Fiduciary  shall  be  responsible  for  the  proper
exercise  of its  own  powers,  duties,  responsibilities  and  obligations
under this Plan and the Trust  instrument and shall not be responsible  for
any act or failure to act of another  Fiduciary.  No  Fiduciary  guarantees
the Trust in any manner against  investment  loss or  depreciation in asset
value.
            9.2  Administration:  The  Plan  shall be  administered  by the
Plan  Administrator  which may appoint or employ  individuals  to assist in
the  administration  of the Plan and which may  appoint or employ any other
agents  it  deems  advisable,   including  legal  counsel,   actuaries  and
auditors  to serve at the Plan  Administrator's  direction.  All  usual and
reasonable  expenses of maintaining,  operating and  administering the Plan
and the Trust, including the expenses of the Plan Administrator and the

                  (referred  to as a  `year  of  eligibility  service').
                  The  12-month  period  between  the date the  Employee
                  first  completes  one Hour of  Service  and the  first
                  anniversary   thereof  shall  be  used   initially  to

                  practicable   after   September  30,  1995,  the  term
                  `payroll  date' shall  replace  `January 1 or July' in
                  the first sentence of this subparagraph."
            B.2   Modification   to  Section   4.1:   For   purposes  of
determining  the  deferral  amount in the case of an Active  Participant
who is covered by this Article,  subsections (a), (d) and (e) of Section
4.1 shall read as follows:
                  "(a)  Deferral  Amount:  Subject  to  the  limitations
      established by this Article IV, each active  Participant may defer
      in any Plan Year up to $60 of his Eligible Pay per pay period,  in
      accordance  with such rules and  regulations as may be established
      by the  Plan  Administrator.  In  the  event  that  a  Participant
      elects to defer a portion of his Eligible  Pay under the Plan,  it
      will be designated for  contribution  by the Employer to the Trust
      on  behalf  of the  Participant,  and for  deposit  in his  Salary
      Deferral  Account.   All  amounts  deposited  to  a  Participant's
      Salary Deferral Account shall at all times be fully vested."
                  "(d)  Election  Procedures:  An election made pursuant
      to  subsection  (b) or (c) above shall be in the manner  specified
      by the Plan  Administrator.  Any election shall specify the amount

  eligibility service"). The 12-month period between the date the Employee first
  completes one Hour of Service and the first anniversary  thereof shall be used

  beginning  with the first Plan Year  commencing  after he first  completes one
  Hour of Service  shall be credited with two years of  eligibility  service for

  continue to  participate  actively in the Plan until he revokes his enrollment
  or his  enrollment  ends as a  result  of his  Termination  of  Employment  or

  participation  ceases,  an individual with a balance in his Plan Account shall
  continue as an Inactive Participant until his Account has been distributed.

                  (c) Recommencement of Active Participation: Subject to Section
  3.3, any individual  whose active  participation  has  terminated  pursuant to
  subsection  (b)  may  return  to  active   participation  by  reinstating  his
  enrollment  (following  his  return to  service as an  eligible  Employee,  if
  applicable).

     3.3 Break in Service:  This section  shall apply in the case of an Employee
  described in Section 3.1(b) who has a break in service,  as defined below.  In
  determining  such  Employee's  post-break   participation  in  the  Plan,  the
  Employee's  pre-break  years  of  eligibility  service  following  his  rehire
  (determined under Section 3.2 as if his employment first commenced on his date
  of  rehire).   For  purposes  hereof,  a  "break  in  service"  shall  mean  a
  12-consecutive-month  computation  period during which an Employee is credited
  with 500 or less Hours of Service. The
                                      


<PAGE> III-3


  applicable  computation  period for determining breaks in service shall be the

  commencing after such date of employement.
