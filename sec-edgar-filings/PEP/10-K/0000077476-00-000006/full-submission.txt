                                     PART I


Item 1.   Business

         PepsiCo,   Inc.   was   incorporated   in  Delaware  in  1919  and  was
reincorporated in North Carolina in 1986.  PepsiCo is engaged in the snack food,
soft drink and juice  businesses.  When used in this Report the terms "we", "us"
and "our" means PepsiCo and its divisions and subsidiaries.

         In 1998, our Board of Directors approved a plan for the separation from
PepsiCo  of  certain  wholly-owned  bottling  businesses  located  in the United
States,  Canada,  Spain,  Greece and Russia,  referred to as The Pepsi  Bottling
Group (PBG).  On April 6, 1999,  PBG completed the sale of 100 million shares of
its  common  stock at $23 per share  through  an  initial  public  offering.  We
retained a noncontrolling  ownership  interest of approximately  40%,  including
ownership  of  approximately  7% of the  equity  of  PBG's  principal  operating
subsidiary, Bottling Group, LLC.

         On May 20, 1999, we combined certain of our bottling  operations in the
midwestern United States and Central Europe with Whitman Corporation, a publicly
traded  corporation.   We  retained  a  noncontrolling   ownership  interest  of
approximately 38% in "new Whitman".  The remainder of the ownership  interest in
new Whitman is held by the public.

         On July 10, 1999, we formed a business venture with PepCom  Industries,
Inc., a Pepsi-Cola  franchisee,  combining bottling businesses in parts of North
Carolina and New York.  PepCom  contributed  bottling  operations in central and
eastern  North  Carolina  and in  Long  Island,  New  York  to the  venture.  We
contributed  our bottling  operations in  Winston-Salem  and  Wilmington,  North
Carolina in exchange for a noncontrolling interest of 35% in the venture.

         On  October  15,  1999,  we  formed  a  business  venture  with  Pohlad
Companies, a Pepsi-Cola franchisee, combining bottling businesses in Puerto Rico
and parts of the  southeastern  and midwestern  United States.  Pohlad Companies
contributed its interests in Dakota Beverage Company, Delta Beverage Group, Inc.
(Delta) and Pepsi-Cola  Puerto Rico Bottling  Company (PPR).  We contributed our
interests  in Delta and PPR as well as 2.2  million  shares of  PepsiCo  Capital
Stock. As a result, we have a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately
24% in the venture's  principal  operating  subsidiary,  PepsiAmericas,  Inc., a
publicly traded corporation.


FRITO-LAY, INC.

         Our  Frito-Lay  domestic  snack food business is conducted by Frito-Lay
North America (FLNA).  Our international  snack food business is described below
under the  heading  Frito-Lay  International  (FLI).  Its  geographic  units are
Frito-Lay   Europe/Middle   East/Africa   and   Frito-Lay   Latin   America/Asia
Pacific/Australia.

         FLNA

         FLNA  manufactures,  markets,  sells and  distributes  a varied line of
salty and sweet snack foods  throughout the United States and Canada,  including
LAY'S and RUFFLES brand potato chips, DORITOS and TOSTITOS brand tortilla chips,
FRITOS brand corn chips,  CHEETOS brand cheese flavored snacks,  ROLD GOLD brand
pretzels,  SUNCHIPS  brand  multigrain  snacks,  WOW!  brand  low fat and no fat
versions of potato and  tortilla  chips,  a variety of branded  dips and salsas,
CRACKER JACK brand candy-coated popcorn and GRANDMA'S brand cookies.

                                       2
<PAGE>



         FLNA's  products are  transported  from  manufacturing  plants to major
distribution  centers,  principally  by  company-owned  trucks.  FLNA utilizes a
"store-door-delivery"  system,  whereby  its sales  force  delivers  the  snacks
directly to the store  shelf.  This system  permits  FLNA to work  closely  with
retail trade locations and to be responsive to their needs.  Frito-Lay  believes
this  form of  distribution  allows  it to  have a  marketing  advantage  and is
essential for the proper distribution of products with a short shelf life.

         Frito-Lay   also  develops  the  national   marketing,   promotion  and
advertising programs that support the Frito-Lay brands and brand image; oversees
the quality of the Frito-Lay products;  develops new products and packaging; and
leads and coordinates selling efforts.

         FLI

         FLI's products are available in 118 countries outside the United States
and Canada through company-owned facilities and affiliated companies. On most of
the  European  continent,  our snack food  business is conducted  through  Snack
Ventures  Europe,  a joint venture between  PepsiCo and General Mills,  Inc., in
which we own a 60% interest.  In ten Latin  American  countries,  our snack food
business is conducted  through  joint  ventures  between  PepsiCo and the parent
company of  Empresas  Polar SA of  Venezuela.  We have a 50%  interest  in these
ventures, except in one country in which we own a 70% interest.

         FLI sells a variety of snack food products which appeal to local tastes
including,  for  example,  WALKERS  brand  snack  foods in the  United  Kingdom,
SABRITAS  brand snack foods in Mexico,  Smith's  brand snack foods in Australia,
and GAMESA brand  cookies and ALEGRO brand sweet snacks in Mexico.  In addition,
many of our U. S. brands  have been  introduced  internationally  such as LAY'S,
RUFFLES,  DORITOS,  TOSTITOS,  FRITOS,  and CHEETOS  brand  salty  snack  foods.
Principal   international  markets  include  Australia,   Brazil,   Mexico,  the
Netherlands, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom.

         FLI develops the  marketing,  promotion and  advertising  programs that
support the local and Frito-Lay brands and develops new products and packaging.


Pepsi-Cola Company

products are sold in approximately 160 countries through PCI's company-owned and
franchised bottlers.  Principal international markets include Argentina, Brazil,
China, India,  Mexico, the Philippines,  Saudi Arabia,  Spain,  Thailand and the

         PCI,  with  its  bottlers,   develops  the  marketing,   promotion  and

Competition

         All of our businesses  are highly  competitive.  Our snack foods,  soft
drinks and, juices compete in the United States and internationally  with widely
distributed  products of a number of major companies that have plants in many of
the areas we serve,  as well as with private label snack foods,  soft drinks and
juices and with the products of local and regional manufacturers. The main areas
of our competition are price, quality and variety of products,  customer service
and availability of distribution.

Employees

         As of December 25, 1999, we employed,  subject to seasonal  variations,
approximately  118,000  persons  worldwide,  of whom  approximately  52,000 were
employed within the United States.  We believe that relations with our employees
are generally good.

Raw Materials and Other Supplies

         The principal  materials we use in our snack food, soft drink and juice
businesses  are  corn  sweeteners,   sugar,  aspartame,   flavorings,   oranges,
grapefruit,  juice concentrates,  vegetable and essential oils, potatoes,  corn,
flour,  seasonings and packaging materials.  Since we rely on trucks to move and
distribute many of our products,  fuel is also an important commodity. We employ
specialists  to secure  adequate  supplies  of many of these  items and have not
experienced any significant  continuous shortages.  Prices we pay for such items
are subject to fluctuation. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such
increases to our customers.  When we have decided to pass along price  increases
in the past we have done so successfully. However, there is no assurance that we
will be able to do so in the future.

Governmental Regulation

         The conduct of our businesses, and the production, distribution and use
of many of our products,  are subject to various federal laws, such as the Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Occupational  Safety and Health Act and the Americans
with  Disabilities  Act. Our  businesses  are also  subject to state,  local and
foreign laws.


Patents, Trademarks and Licenses

         We  own  numerous  valuable  trademarks  which  are  essential  to  our
worldwide businesses,  including FRITO-LAY,  LAY'S, DORITOS, RUFFLES,  TOSTITOS,
FRITOS, CHEETOS, CRACKER JACK, ROLD GOLD, WOW!, SUNCHIPS,  SANTITAS,  SMARTFOOD,
SABRITAS, WALKERS, SMITH'S, PEPSI-COLA, PEPSI, DIET PEPSI, PEPSI ONE, PEPSI MAX,
MOUNTAIN DEW,  SLICE,  MUG, ALL SPORT,  AQUAFINA,  7UP and DIET 7UP (outside the
United  States),  MIRINDA,  TROPICANA  PURE PREMIUM,  TROPICANA  SEASON'S  BEST,
TROPICANA  TWISTER,   TROPICANA  PURE  TROPICS,  COPELLA,  FRUVITA,  and  LOOZA.
Trademarks  remain valid so long as they are used  properly  for  identification
purposes,  and we emphasize  correct use of our  trademarks.  We have authorized
(through  licensing  arrangements)  the use of many  of our  trademarks  in such
contexts as snack food joint ventures and Pepsi-Cola bottling  appointments.  In
addition,  we license the use of our  trademarks on collateral  products for the
primary purpose of enhancing brand awareness.

         We either own or have  licenses to use a number of patents which relate
to some of our products and the processes for their production and to the design
and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents
are licensed to others.

material  with respect to our capital  expenditures,  net income or  competitive
position.

<PAGE>


General

         The Company owns its corporate  headquarters buildings in Purchase, New
York.

         With a few exceptions, leases of plants in the United States and Canada
are on a long-term basis,  expiring at various times,  with options to renew for
additional periods. Most international plants are leased for varying and usually
shorter periods, with or without renewal options.

         We believe that our properties are in good operating  condition and are
suitable for the purposes for which they are being used.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

         We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits,
taxes,  environmental  and other  matters  arising  out of the normal  course of
business.  Management believes that the ultimate liability, if any, in excess of
amounts  already  recognized for such claims or  contingencies  is not likely to
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition
or liquidity.

Item  7.  Management's   Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Results  of  Operations,
Consolidated Cash Flows and Liquidity and Capital Resources

Management's  Discussion and Analysis  (tabular  dollars in millions  except per
share amounts; all per share amounts assume dilution)

All per share information is computed using weighted average shares outstanding,
assuming dilution.

INTRODUCTION

Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  is  presented  in  four  sections.  The
Introductory section discusses Bottling Transactions,  Acquisitions, Market Risk
(including the EURO  conversion),  Year 2000, Asset Impairment and Restructuring
Charges and a New Accounting  Standard (pages 9-15). The second section analyzes
the Results of Operations,  first on a  consolidated  basis and then for each of
our  business  segments  (pages  15-24).  The final  two  sections  address  our
Consolidated Cash Flows and Liquidity and Capital Resources (pages 24-25).

Cautionary Statements

From  time  to  time,  in  written  reports  (including  the  Chairman's  letter
accompanying this annual report) and in oral statements, we discuss expectations
regarding  our future  performance,  the impact of the Euro  conversion  and the
impact  of  current  global   macro-economic   issues.  These   "forward-looking
statements" are based on currently available competitive, financial and economic
data and our operating plans. They are inherently uncertain,  and investors must
recognize  that  events  could  turn  out  to be  significantly  different  from
expectations.

Bottling Transactions

During 1999, we completed four  transactions  creating four anchor bottlers.  In
April,  certain  wholly-owned  bottling  businesses,  referred  to as The  Pepsi
Bottling  Group  (PBG),  completed  an  initial  public  offering  with  PepsiCo
retaining  a direct  noncontrolling  ownership  interest  of 35.5%.  In May,  we
combined  certain  bottling  operations  with Whitman  Corporation to create new
Whitman,  retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 38%. In
July, we formed a business  venture with PepCom  Industries,  Inc., a Pepsi-Cola
franchisee,  retaining  a  noncontrolling  interest  in the  venture of 35%.  In
October,  we formed a business  venture  with  Pohlad  Companies,  a  Pepsi-Cola
franchisee,  retaining a noncontrolling  ownership interest of approximately 24%
in the venture's principal operating  subsidiary.  Details of these transactions
are found in Note 2.

Acquisitions

During 1999, we made  acquisitions,  primarily  investments in various  bottlers
including  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates,  which  aggregated  $430
million in cash.

During 1998,  acquisitions  aggregated $4.5 billion in cash including  Tropicana
Products,  Inc. for $3.3 billion and The Smith's  Snackfoods  Company  (TSSC) in
Australia for $270 million, the remaining ownership interest in various bottlers
and purchases of various other international salty snack food businesses.

The  results  of  operations  of  acquisitions  are  generally  included  in the
consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.

Market Risk

The principal  market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes
in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are:
     o   commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials,
     o   foreign exchange risks, and
     o   interest rates on our debt and short-term investment portfolios.

Commodity Prices
- ----------------

We are subject to market risk with  respect to the cost of  commodities  because
our ability to recover  increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by
the  competitive  environment in which we operate.  We use futures  contracts to
hedge  fluctuations in prices of a portion of anticipated  commodity  purchases,
primarily  oil,  corn,  fuel and juice  concentrates.  We had commodity  futures
positions  of $145 million at December 25, 1999 and $105 million at December 26,
1998.  Unrealized  losses on net commodity  futures positions were $6 million at
December 25, 1999 and $9 million at December 26,  1998.  We estimate  that a 10%
decline in commodity  prices would have increased the 1999 unrealized  losses by
$14 million and the 1998 unrealized losses by $9 million.

Foreign Exchange Risks
- ----------------------

Operating in international  markets involves  exposure to volatile  movements in
foreign  exchange rates.  The economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements
on us is complex  because such changes are often linked to  variability  in real
growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. These
changes,  if  material,  can  cause us to adjust  our  financing  and  operating
strategies.  Consequently,  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not
incorporate these other important economic factors.

International  operations  constitute  about 19% of our 1999 and 19% of our 1998
consolidated  operating  profit,  excluding asset  impairment and  restructuring
charges. As foreign exchange rates change,  translation of the income statements
of  our  international  businesses  into  U.S.  dollars  affects  year-over-year
comparability of operating results.  We do not generally hedge translation risks
because  cash flows  from  international  operations  are  generally  reinvested
locally. We do not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings
because we do not believe it is justified by the exposure or the cost.

Changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  that  would  have the  largest  impact on
translating  our  international  operating  profit for 1999  include the Mexican
peso,  British pound, EURO and Canadian dollar. We estimate that a 10% change in
foreign  exchange  rates would  impact  operating  profit by  approximately  $60
million in 1999 and $51 million in 1998.  This  represents  10% of our  non-U.S.
operating profit after adjusting for asset impairment and restructuring charges.
We believe that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations, as discussed
in the first  paragraph  of this  section.  Further,  the  sensitivity  analysis
disregards the possibility  that rates can move in opposite  directions and that
gains from one country may or may not be offset by losses from another country.

Foreign exchange gains and losses reflect  transaction gains and losses and also
translation gains and losses arising from the remeasurement into U.S. dollars of
the  net  monetary  assets  of  businesses  in  highly  inflationary  countries.
Transaction  gains  and  losses  arise  from  monetary  assets  and  liabilities
denominated  in currencies  other than a business  unit's  functional  currency.
There were net foreign  exchange  losses of $10 million in 1999,  $53 million in
1998 and $16 million in 1997.  The  decrease in net foreign  exchange  losses in
1999 resulted  primarily from the impact in 1998 of  unfavorable  macro-economic
conditions, primarily in Russia and Asia Pacific.

                                       10

In 1998, the economic turmoil in Russia which accompanied the devaluation of the
ruble had an adverse impact on our  operations.  Consequently,  we experienced a
significant drop in demand, resulting in lower net sales and increased operating
losses.  Also,  since net bottling  sales in Russia were  denominated in rubles,
whereas a substantial portion of our related costs and expenses were denominated
in U.S. dollars,  bottling operating margins were further eroded. In response to
these conditions, we reduced our cost structure primarily by closing facilities,
renegotiating  manufacturing  contracts and reducing the number of employees. We
also wrote down our long-lived  bottling  assets to give effect to the resulting
impairment. See "- Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges" on page 12.

On  January 1, 1999,  11 of 15 member  countries  of the  European  Union  fixed
conversion rates between their existing  currencies (legacy  currencies) and one
common  currency - the EURO.  The euro trades on currency  exchanges  and may be
used in  business  transactions.  Conversion  to the  euro  eliminated  currency
exchange rate risk between the member countries.  Beginning in January 2002, new
EURO-denominated  bills and coins will be issued,  and legacy currencies will be
withdrawn  from  circulation.  Our operating  subsidiaries  affected by the euro
conversion  have  established  plans to address  the  issues  raised by the euro
currency  conversion.  These issues  include,  among  others,  the need to adapt
computer and  financial  systems,  business  processes  and  equipment,  such as
vending machines, to accommodate EURO-denominated transactions and the impact of
one common currency on pricing.  Since financial systems and processes currently
accommodate multiple currencies,  the plans contemplate conversion by the middle
of 2001 if not already  addressed  in  conjunction  with other system or process
initiatives.  We do not expect the system and equipment  conversion  costs to be
material.  Due to numerous  uncertainties,  we cannot  reasonably  estimate  the
long-term  effects one common  currency  will have on pricing and the  resulting
impact, if any, on financial condition or results of operations.

Interest Rates
- --------------

We centrally manage our debt and investment  portfolios  considering  investment
opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies.

We use interest rate and currency swaps to effectively  change the interest rate
and  currency of specific  debt  issuances,  with the  objective of reducing our
overall  borrowing  costs.  These swaps are entered into  concurrently  with the
issuance of the debt that they are  intended  to modify.  The  notional  amount,
interest  payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the principal,  interest
payment and maturity dates of the related debt. Accordingly,  any market risk or
opportunity  associated with these swaps is offset by the opposite market impact
on the related debt.

Our investment  portfolios  primarily consist of cash equivalents and short-term
marketable  securities.  Accordingly,  the carrying amounts  approximate  market
value. It is our practice to hold these investments to maturity.

Assuming  year-end  1999 and 1998 variable rate debt and  investment  levels,  a
one-point  increase in interest rates would have increased net interest  expense
by $13 million in 1999 and $64  million in 1998.  The change in this impact from
1998 resulted from  decreased  variable rate debt levels and increased  variable
rate investment levels at year-end 1999. This sensitivity analysis does not take
into account existing interest rate swaps.

Year 2000

To  date,   neither  we  nor  our  franchise  bottlers  have  experienced  major
disruptions related to the Year 2000 date change. In addition,  we are not aware
of significant  Year 2000 disruptions  impacting our customers or suppliers.  We
will continue to monitor our critical  systems over the next several  months but
do not anticipate a significant impact as a result of the Year 2000 date change.

Incremental  costs directly  related to Year 2000 issues for new PepsiCo totaled
$110  million  from  1998 to  2000.  Approximately  26% of the  total  estimated
spending  represents costs to repair systems while  approximately 53% represents
costs to replace and rewrite software.  Excluded from the estimated  incremental
costs for new PepsiCo for the three-year period are approximately $29 million of
internal recurring costs related to our Year 2000 efforts.

1999
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 1999 asset impairment and restructuring  charge of $65 million recognized in
the first  quarter  relates to the  closure of three  plants and  impairment  of
equipment  at  Frito-Lay  North  America.  This charge was the second phase of a
productivity  improvement plan developed in the fourth quarter of 1998. The plan
included the consolidation of U.S. production to newer and more efficient plants
and streamlining  logistics and  transportation  systems.  The  restructuring is
expected to generate  approximately  $15 million in annual savings  beginning in
2000 which we expect to reinvest back into the business.

The asset  impairment  charges  primarily  reflect the reduction in the carrying
value of the land and  buildings to their  estimated  fair market value based on
current selling prices for comparable  real estate,  less costs to sell, and the
write off of the net book value of  equipment  which cannot be  redeployed.  The
plant  closures were  completed  during 1999.  The majority of these assets were
either  disposed  of or  abandoned  in 1999.  The  restructuring  charges of $28
million primarily  included  severance costs for approximately 860 employees and
plant closing costs. Substantially all of the terminations occurred during 1999.

1998
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 1998  asset  impairment  and  restructuring  charges  of $288  million  were
comprised of the following:

o    A  charge of $218  million  for asset  impairment  of $200  million and
     restructuring  charges  of $18  million  related  to our  Russian  bottling
     operations.  The economic  turmoil in Russia which  accompanied  the August
     1998   devaluation  of  the  ruble   adversely   impacted  our  operations.
     Consequently,  we  experienced a significant  drop in demand,  resulting in
     lower net sales and increased  operating  losses.  Also, since net bottling
     sales in Russia were denominated in rubles,  whereas a substantial  portion
     of our  related  costs  and  expenses  were  denominated  in U.S.  dollars,
     bottling  operating  margins  were  further  eroded.  In  response to these
     conditions,  we  reduced  our  cost  structure  primarily  through  closing
     facilities,  renegotiating  manufacturing contracts and reducing the number
     of  employees.  We  also  evaluated  our  long-lived  bottling  assets  for
     impairment,  triggered by the reduction in  utilization of assets caused by
     the lower  demand,  the  adverse  change in the  business  climate  and the
     expected continuation of operating losses and cash deficits in that market.
     The  impairment  charge  reduced  the net book value of the assets to their
     estimated fair market value,  based primarily on amounts  recently paid for
     similar  assets in that  marketplace.  Of the total charge of $218 million,
     $212 million related to bottling operations that became part of PBG in 1999
     (see "- Bottling Transactions" on page 9).

o    An impairment  charge of $54 million related to manufacturing  equipment at
     Frito-Lay  North  America.  As part of our annual  assessment  of marketing
     plans and related capacity  requirements at Frito-Lay North America and the
     development  of  a  program  to  improve  manufacturing  productivity,   we
     determined  that certain product  specific  equipment would not be utilized
     and  certain  capital  projects  would be  terminated  to avoid  production
     redundancies.  The charge primarily reflected the write off of the net book
     value of the equipment and related  projects.  Disposal or  abandonment  of
     these assets was completed in 1999.

o    A charge of $16 million  for  employee  related  costs  resulting  from the
     separation  of  Pepsi-Cola   North   America's   concentrate  and  bottling
     organizations  to more  effectively  serve retail customers in light of the
     conversion of PBG to public  ownership  (see "- Bottling  Transactions"  on
     page 9). Of this amount,  $10 million  related to bottling  operations that
     became part of PBG in 1999.


                                       13
<PAGE>


The employee related costs for 1998 of $24 million primarily  included severance
and relocation costs for  approximately  2,700 employees  located in the Russian
bottling plants and at Pepsi-Cola  North America field  locations.  During 1998,
approximately 2,600 of the terminations occurred most of which were terminations
of part-time  employees with little associated cost. The remaining  terminations
either  occurred in 1999 or related to the bottling  operations that became part
of PBG in 1999.

1997
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 1997  asset  impairment  and  restructuring  charges  of $290  million  were
comprised of the following:

o    Net charges of $183  million in several of our  business  segments  for net
     asset  impairment of $150 million related to the planned disposal of assets
     and for restructuring  charges of $33 million.  The impairment charges were
     taken as a result of decisions to dispose of certain company-owned bottling
     operations  and non-core  international  businesses,  to dispose of certain
     assets to improve the  utilization  of facilities  and to reduce  occupancy
     costs and to exit certain bottling joint ventures.  The impairment  charges
     reduced the net book value of these assets to their  estimated  fair market
     value,  generally based on estimates developed internally or, if available,
     amounts paid for similar assets, less costs to sell. The disposals occurred
     in  1997  and  1998  and in  connection  with  the  separation  of  certain
     company-owned  bottling  operations (see "- Bottling  Transactions" on page
     9). The restructuring charges primarily related to the reorganization of an
     international company-owned bottling operation.

o    Charges  of  $94   million  for  asset   impairment   of  $48  million  and
     restructuring charges of $46 million related to productivity initiatives in
     worldwide snacks.  These initiatives  included closing plants,  eliminating
     production lines and consolidating  distribution facilities.  The resulting
     impairment  charges were recognized  primarily for assets held for disposal
     or abandonment  and reduced the net book value of impaired  assets to their
     estimated  fair  market  value,  generally  based  on  estimates  developed
     internally or, if available, amounts paid for similar assets, less costs to
     sell.  Disposal or abandonment of these assets was substantially  completed
     in 1997, with a significant  portion of the remainder  completed in 1998 as
     planned.

o    Net charges of $13 million for net asset  impairment  of $2 million and net
     restructuring  charges of $11 million  related to actions to strengthen our
     international  bottling  structure.  Restructuring  charges of $98  million
     consisted  of third party  termination  payments  related to  refranchising
     bottling  operations and our investments in bottling joint ventures.  These
     charges  were  substantially  offset by an  arbitration  settlement  of $87
     million  which  we were  awarded  as a  result  of the  termination  of the
     bottling appointment with our previous Venezuelan bottler.

The employee related costs for 1997 of $55 million primarily  included severance
and relocation  costs for  approximately  2,100 employees  primarily  located in
international  plants and  distribution  centers.  During 1997,  terminations of
approximately   1,100  employees  occurred  and,  in  1998,   approximately  500
terminations  occurred. As a result of the successful  redeployment of employees
to other  locations,  approximately  500  terminations  did not occur as planned
which resulted in a change of estimate in 1998.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The  restructuring  reserves are included in accounts  payable and other current
liabilities in the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet. At year-end 1999, the remaining
liability  for  1997  restructuring   charges  associated  with  investments  in
unconsolidated  affiliates  was  $10  million  related  to  indemnifications  of
litigation liabilities.

                                       14
<PAGE>


The remaining  carrying  amounts of assets held for disposal at year end were $6
million in 1999, $13 million in 1998 and $60 million in 1997. The net sales from
international  bottling  business  units held for disposal  were $202 million in
1998 and $590 million in 1997. Such businesses  generated  operating  profits of
$20 million in 1998 and $42 million in 1997. Our  investments in  unconsolidated
affiliates held for disposal provided  break-even  results in 1999 and losses of
$2 million in 1998 and $5 million in 1997.

New Accounting Standard

In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging  Activities.  SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 137, is effective for our
fiscal year  beginning  2001.  SFAS 133  establishes  accounting  and  reporting
standards for derivative  instruments,  including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other  contracts,  and for hedging  activities.  It requires that we
recognize all  derivative  instruments  as either assets or  liabilities  in the
Consolidated  Balance Sheet and measure those  instruments at fair value. We are
currently  assessing  the effects of  adopting  SFAS 133 and have not yet made a
determination  of the impact  adoption will have on our  consolidated  financial
statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Review

General

In the  discussions  below,  the  year-over-year  dollar change in pound or kilo
sales  of  salty  and  sweet  snacks  for  Frito-Lay,   bottler  case  sales  by
company-owned  bottling operations and concentrate unit sales to franchisees for
Pepsi-Cola,  and  four-gallon  equivalent  cases for Tropicana is referred to as
volume. Price changes over the prior year and the impact of product, package and
country sales mix changes are referred to as effective net pricing.

The  combined  results of our five  reportable  segments  are referred to as new
PepsiCo.

Reported net sales decreased $2.0 billion in 1999 reflecting the deconsolidation
of PBG, PBO and PepCom operations as of the transaction closing dates, partially
offset by the inclusion of Tropicana for the first three  quarters of 1999.  New
PepsiCo net sales, before the intercompany elimination,  increased $2.4 billion.
This increase  primarily reflects the inclusion of Tropicana for the first three
quarters of 1999,  volume gains at worldwide  Frito-Lay and higher effective net
pricing at  worldwide  Frito-Lay  and  Pepsi-Cola  North  America.  Volume gains
contributed  4  percentage   points  of  growth  and  higher  effective  pricing
contributed 3 percentage  points.  These  advances were  partially  offset by an
unfavorable  foreign currency impact.  The unfavorable  foreign currency impact,
primarily in Brazil and Mexico, reduced new PepsiCo net sales growth by nearly 2
percentage points.

Reported  net sales rose $1.4  billion in 1998.  New PepsiCo  net sales,  before
intercompany elimination,  increased $1.2 billion. This increase reflects volume
gains in all businesses,  net contributions from  acquisitions/divestitures  and
higher  effective  net pricing  driven by a shift to  higher-priced  products in
Frito-Lay North America. Volume gains contributed 5 percentage points of growth.
Net  acquisitions/divestitures  contributed  3  percentage  points  to the sales
growth and primarily  reflect the acquisition of Tropicana  partially  offset by
the absence of bottling sales as a result of  refranchising  a Japanese  bottler
late in 1997.  Excluding  foreign currency  impact,  new PepsiCo net sales would
have risen 9%. Weaker foreign currencies primarily in Canada, Thailand,  Brazil,
Poland and India led the unfavorable foreign currency impact.

1999, 1998 and 1997,  respectively  (see Notes 4 and 18). * Based on new PepsiCo
net sales before intercompany elimination.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reported  operating  profit  margin  increased  2.2  percentage  points in 1999.
Ongoing new PepsiCo  operating profit margin declined 0.3 percentage  point. The
decline  reflects the margin impact of the Tropicana  acquisition  for the first
three  quarters,   increased  general  and  administrative  (G&A)  expenses  and
increased advertising and marketing (A&M) expenses across all business segments.
These decreases were partially  offset by the margin impact of higher  effective
net pricing.

The most  significant  G&A increase in 1999 was corporate G&A which includes $71
million   related  to  the  start-up,   project   management,   development  and
installation of a shared  services  program.  The shared  services  program will
provide common system  capabilities,  data management and data processing across
North America and Continental  Europe.  The increase in A&M was led by increases
in promotional allowances at Frito-Lay North America,  bottler funding and other
programs at Pepsi-Cola  North America and spending at Frito-Lay  International's
U.K. business.

<PAGE>


In 1998,  reported  operating profit margin  decreased over 1 percentage  point.
Ongoing new PepsiCo  operating  profit margin declined over 1 percentage  point,
primarily  reflecting the margin impact of increased  A&M,  higher cost of sales
and increased selling and distribution expenses,  partially offset by the impact
of volume growth.  A&M grew at a  significantly  faster rate than sales,  led by
increases at worldwide Pepsi-Cola and increases at Frito-Lay North America. Cost
of sales as a percentage  of sales  increased due to costs  associated  with new
plants and lines at Frito-Lay  North  America.  Selling and  distribution  (S&D)
expense  growth at Frito-Lay  North  America  reflected an increase in the sales
force.  Excluding  foreign exchange losses,  ongoing operating profit would have
increased  1%.  Foreign  exchange  losses,  primarily  in Asia,  are reported in
corporate  unallocated expenses.  Information  technology expense increased on a
year-over-year   basis,   despite  $42  million  of  software  costs  that  were
capitalized  as  required  by  SOP  98-1,  driven  by our  various  productivity
initiatives and Year 2000 remediation efforts.

Gain on Bottling Transactions

The gain on bottling  transactions  of $1.0 billion ($270  million  after-tax or
$0.18  per  share)  relates  to the  second  quarter  PBG and  Whitman  bottling
transactions.  The PBG  transaction  resulted in a pre-tax  gain of $1.0 billion
($476  million  after-tax or $0.32 per share) in the second  quarter  consistent
with our policy for gain recognition upon the issuance of stock by a subsidiary.
The majority of the taxes are expected to be deferred indefinitely.  The Whitman
transaction  resulted in an  after-tax  loss to us of $206  million or $0.14 per
share.

The third quarter PepCom transaction was accounted for as a nonmonetary exchange
for book purposes.  A portion of the  transaction  was taxable which resulted in
income tax expense of $25 million or $0.02 per share.

The fourth  quarter Pohlad  transaction  was structured as a fair value exchange
with no resulting gain or loss.

Interest Expense, net

Interest expense,  net of interest income,  declined $76 million or 24% in 1999.
Interest  income  increased $44 million or 59%  primarily due to higher  average
investment  balances,  partially offset by lower average interest rates on these
balances. The higher average investment balances primarily result from the first
quarter  proceeds  received from PBG as settlement of pre-existing  intercompany
balances.  Interest  expense  decreased  $32 million or 8% due to lower  average
interest rates on slightly lower average outstanding debt levels.

Interest  expense,  net of interest income,  declined $32 million or 9% in 1998.
The decline in interest expense of $83 million or 17% was primarily due to lower
average debt levels,  as a result of using cash flows received from discontinued
operations in the latter half of 1997 to repay debt.  The lower debt levels were
maintained  until the end of the third quarter when the debt level  increased to
finance several  acquisitions (see "- Acquisitions" on page 9). This decline was
partially  offset  by  higher  average  interest  rates on the  remaining  debt.
Interest income declined $51 million or 41% reflecting lower  investment  levels
as a result of  utilizing  investment  balances to make  acquisitions  and repay
debt.

Ongoing  excludes the effects of the bottling  transactions in 1999,  impairment
and  restructuring  charges  for all years (see Note 4) and the 1998  income tax
benefit (see Note 14).

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In  1999,  the  reported  effective  tax rate  increased  32  percentage  points
primarily  as a result of the tax effects of the bottling  transactions  and the
absence in 1999 of the 1998 income tax benefit.  The ongoing  effective tax rate
increased 1.2 percentage point. The increase resulted primarily from the absence
in 1999 of the  settlement  in 1998 of prior years'  audit issues  offset by the
benefit of proportionately lower bottling income.

In 1998,  the reported  effective  tax rate  decreased  23.5  percentage  points
primarily  as a result of an income tax  benefit of $494  million  (or $0.32 per
share).  The tax benefit  reflects a final  agreement with the Internal  Revenue
Service to settle  substantially all remaining aspects of a tax case relating to
our  concentrate  operations  in Puerto  Rico.  The ongoing  effective  tax rate
declined 2.4 percentage points attributable to the favorable settlement of prior
years' audit issues,  including issues related to the deductibility of purchased
franchise rights.

For 1999, reported income from continuing operations increased $57 million while
income per share  increased  $0.06.  Ongoing income from  continuing  operations
increased  $85  million  and  income  per share  increased  $0.07.  The  ongoing
increases  are due to  increased  operating  profit,  a decrease in net interest
expense and, for income per share,  the benefit from a 1.5% reduction in average
shares outstanding. These were partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.

                                       18

For 1998,  reported  income from  continuing  operations  increased $502 million
while  income  per  share  increased  $0.36.   Ongoing  income  from  continuing
operations  increased  $30 million  and income per share  increased  $0.06.  The
ongoing  increases  are due to the lower  effective tax rate and, for income per
share, the benefit from a 3% reduction in average shares outstanding. These were
partially offset by lower operating profit.

Net Income and Net Income Per Share

For 1997,  net income of $2.1 billion and income per share of $1.36  include the
results of income from  discontinued  operations,  which  primarily  reflect the
operating results of Tricon's core restaurant businesses through October 6, 1997
and the  operating  results  and a gain on sale of the  restaurant  distribution
operation sold in the second quarter of 1997.

1999 vs. 1998
- -------------

Net sales  grew $391  million  due to volume  gains  and  higher  effective  net
pricing.

Pound volume advanced 4%. The advance was led by high single-digit growth in our
core corn products,  excluding the low-fat and no-fat versions, mid single-digit
growth in Lay's brand potato chips and significant  growth in Cracker Jack brand
products and branded  dips.  Volume  declines in our "WOW!",  "Baked"  Lay's and
"Baked" Tostitos brand products partially offset these gains.

<PAGE>


Reported  operating  profit  increased $156 million.  Ongoing  operating  profit
increased  $167 million  reflecting  the higher  volume,  higher  effective  net
pricing and reduced  commodity  costs,  partially offset by higher A&M expenses.
A&M grew at a faster  rate than sales due  primarily  to  increased  promotional
allowances.

Ongoing  operating  profit margin  increased over 1 percentage  point due to the
margin  impact of higher  effective  net pricing,  reduced  commodity  costs and
volume gains, partially offset by the margin impact of higher A&M expenses.

1998 vs. 1997
- -------------

Net sales grew $507 million due to increased volume and a favorable mix shift to
higher-priced products.

Pound  volume  advanced  5% led by core brand  growth and "WOW!"  products.  The
growth in core brands,  excluding  the low-fat and no-fat  versions,  was led by
double-digit  growth in Lay's  brand  potato  chips and  double-digit  growth in
Doritos brand tortilla chips.  These gains were partially  offset by declines in
Ruffles brand potato chips,  "Baked" Lay's and "Baked"  Tostitos  brand products
and the elimination of Doritos Reduced Fat brand tortilla chips.

Reported  operating  profit  increased  $36 million.  Ongoing  operating  profit
increased $68 million  reflecting the higher volume and the favorable mix shift,
partially  offset by increased  operating costs. The increase in operating costs
was  led  by  increased  A&M,  higher  manufacturing  costs,   reflecting  costs
associated with new plants and lines related to "WOW!" and Doritos 3-D products,
and higher S&D expenses.  A&M grew at a significantly faster rate than sales and
volume due to increased promotional allowances and "WOW!" launch costs. S&D grew
at a slightly slower rate than sales but faster than volume.

1999 vs. 1998
- -------------

Net sales increased $249 million. Excluding the negative impact of Brazil, which
was primarily due to macro-economic conditions, net sales increased $397 million
or 13% reflecting higher volume and higher effective net pricing.  Overall,  the
higher  effective  net  pricing  more  than  offset  the net  impact  of  weaker
currencies outside of Brazil. The unfavorable foreign currency impact, primarily
in Mexico,  reduced net sales growth by 4 percentage  points.  Net contributions
from  acquisitions/divestitures  contributed  1  percentage  point to the  sales
growth.

Salty snack kilos  increased 6%. The advance was led by  double-digit  growth at
Sabritas in Mexico and several of our  businesses  in Central and South  America
and in  Asia.  Including  acquisitions/divestitures,  total  salty  snack  kilos
increased  an  additional  4  percentage  points to 10% driven  primarily by the
acquisition  in Australia  and by  acquisitions  and mergers of salty snack food
businesses in South America. Sweet snack kilos increased 6% led by strong growth
at Gamesa and Sabritas in Mexico. Sweet snack kilos, including the net effect of
acquisitions/divestitures, declined 5% primarily as a result of the sales of our
chocolate and biscuit businesses in Poland.

Operating  profit  increased $39 million.  Excluding  Brazil,  operating  profit
increased $81 million or 25% driven by strong  performances at Sabritas,  Gamesa
and  several  of our  businesses  in Asia.  The net  impact  of  weaker  foreign
currencies  outside of  Brazil,  primarily  in Mexico  and the  United  Kingdom,
reduced operating profit growth by 5 percentage points. The unfavorable  foreign
currency impact was more than offset by higher effective net pricing.

1998 vs. 1997
- -------------

Net sales  increased  $92  million.  The increase in net sales was driven by net
contributions from  acquisitions/divestitures and by higher volume. The increase
was partially  offset by the impact of weaker foreign  currencies  including the
unfavorable  effect in Mexico of the  devaluation  of the peso  against the U.S.
dollar net of local  pricing  actions.  Excluding  Mexico,  the impact of weaker
foreign currencies,  primarily Brazil, Poland,  Australia and Thailand,  reduced
net  sales  growth  by  2  percentage  points.   Net   acquisitions/divestitures
contributed 3 percentage points to the sales growth.

Salty snack kilos increased 6%, led by solid double-digit  growth at Sabritas in
Mexico  and the  Snack  Ventures  Europe  joint  venture,  partially  offset  by
double-digit  declines  in Brazil.  Including  acquisitions/divestitures,  salty
snack kilos increased to 14%. The increase of 8 percentage  points was primarily
driven by the  acquisitions  through  partnership  with, as well as, purchase of
salty  snack food  businesses  in Central and South  America.  Sweet snack kilos
declined  2%  driven  by a  single-digit  decline  at  Gamesa  in  Mexico  and a
double-digit  decline at Wedel in Poland.  These  declines  in sweet snack kilos
were partially  offset by  double-digit  growth at Sabritas.  Sweet snack kilos,
including  the effect of  acquisitions/divestitures,  declined 8% primarily as a
result of the first quarter sale of a French biscuit business.

Reported  operating  profit  increased  $49 million.  Ongoing  operating  profit
declined $13 million.  Deterioration  of operating  performance in Brazil due to
the macro-economic conditions and market softness at Gamesa was partially offset
by growth at  Sabritas  and in Poland.  The  growth in Poland was  substantially
driven by the sweet snack businesses which were sold in early 1999.

Pepsi-Cola
- ----------

In early 1999, in  contemplation  of the separation from PepsiCo of our bottling
operations,   we  completed  a  reorganization   of  our  Pepsi-Cola   business.
Accordingly,  our 1999 disclosure presents the operating results consistent with
the new Pepsi-Cola organization.  Prior years' amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the 1999  presentation.  For additional  information see Note 18. The
discussion  that  follows  presents  net  sales  prior  to  the  elimination  of
intercompany  concentrate sales between  Pepsi-Cola North America and Pepsi-Cola
International and those previously  consolidated bottling operations in which we
now own an equity interest.

System  bottler  case sales  (BCS)  represents  PepsiCo-owned  brands as well as
brands that we have been  granted the right to  produce,  distribute  and market
nationally and are sold by system bottlers.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1999 vs. 1998
- -------------

Reported net sales increased $1.2 billion,  primarily due to the decrease in the
intercompany elimination of concentrate sales resulting from the deconsolidation
of the PBG, PBO and PepCom  bottling  operations.  Before the  elimination,  net
sales  increased  $93  million  reflecting  higher  concentrate  pricing  net of
increased customer support and increased royalty income associated with Aquafina
bottled water.

BCS  increased  nearly  2% led by Pepsi  One,  introduced  late last  year,  mid
single-digit  growth of our Mountain Dew brand and strong double-digit growth of
our  Aquafina  brand of bottled  water.  These  gains were  partially  offset by
single-digit declines in Pepsi and Diet Pepsi brands. Concentrate shipments were
even with prior year.

Reported  operating  profit  increased  $19 million.  Ongoing  operating  profit
increased $13 million  primarily  reflecting  the increase in the net benefit of
the higher  pricing and the  increased  royalty  income.  These  increases  were
partially  offset by higher  fountain  related  costs,  increased  A&M  spending
related to bottler  funding and other  programs and higher G&A costs as a result
of costs associated with building our concentrate company infrastructure.

1998 vs. 1997
- -------------

Reported net sales increased $45 million. Before the elimination of intercompany
concentrate sales, net sales increased $185 million primarily  reflecting higher
concentrate volume.

BCS  increased  6%, led by the strong  single-digit  growth of the  Mountain Dew
brand,  contributions from Pepsi One and strong  double-digit growth of Aquafina
bottled water and Lipton Brisk.  Pepsi and Diet Pepsi brands also contributed to
the  growth,  both  advancing  at  single-digit  rates.   Concentrate  shipments
increased 5%.

Reported  operating  profit  decreased  $23 million.  Ongoing  operating  profit
decreased $69 million  primarily due to planned  increases in A&M and higher G&A
costs.  These  increases  were  partially  offset by the  increased  concentrate
volume.  A&M expenses grew faster than sales and volume  reflecting  new product
launches,  such as Pepsi One, and planned  increases  for Project  Globe and Pop
Culture promotions.  G&A costs grew due to higher costs associated with building
our fountain infrastructure.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1999 vs. 1998
- -------------

Reported net sales  increased  $171 million  which  includes the decrease in the
intercompany  elimination  resulting  from  the  deconsolidation  of PBG and PBO
bottling operations.  Before the elimination of intercompany  concentrate sales,
net sales increased $102 million.  This advance reflects net contributions  from
acquisitions/divestitures,  higher  volume and  higher  effective  net  pricing,
partially  offset  by  a  net  unfavorable  foreign  currency  impact.  The  net
unfavorable  foreign currency  impact,  primarily in Brazil,  Mexico,  India and
Germany, reduced net sales by 3 percentage points.

BCS  increased  1% primarily  reflecting  double-digit  growth in China,  strong
double-digit growth in Germany,  Japan and Pakistan,  and single-digit growth in
India and Saudi Arabia.  These  advances were  partially  offset by lower BCS in
Brazil, Russia, the Philippines and Thailand. Through December total concentrate
shipments to franchisees,  including those former wholly-owned bottlers in which
we now own an equity  interest,  increased  2% while  their BCS  increased  at a
slower rate.

Reported  operating  profit  increased  $9  million.  Ongoing  operating  profit
increased $3 million  reflecting  volume gains and higher effective net pricing.
These    gains   were    reduced    by   higher    A&M,    net    losses    from
acquisitions/divestitures and unfavorable foreign currency impact.

1998 vs. 1997
- -------------

Reported  net  sales   decreased  $335  million.   Before  the   elimination  of
intercompany  concentrate sales, net sales decreased $323 million.  This decline
was primarily due to the absence of Japan  bottling sales in 1998 as a result of
the  refranchising  of our  Japanese  bottler  late in 1997 and net  unfavorable
foreign currency impact,  partially offset by higher volume. The net unfavorable
foreign currency impact, primarily in Thailand and India, reduced net sales by 2
percentage points.

BCS  increased 6% reflecting  double-digit  growth in Mexico,  the  Philippines,
India, Pakistan and China. In addition,  BCS grew at a high double-digit rate in
Venezuela reflecting the continued momentum by the joint venture as it increased
its territories and capacity.  These advances were partially offset by lower BCS
in Japan  due to the  elimination  of  certain  PepsiCo-owned  brands by the new
bottler Suntory.  The PepsiCo-owned  brands that continued to be sold by Suntory
grew  at a  double-digit  rate.  Total  concentrate  shipments  to  franchisees,
including  those  former  wholly-owned  bottlers  in which we now own an  equity
interest, increased 6% while their BCS increased at a slightly higher rate.


                                       23
<PAGE>


Reported  operating  profit  increased $166 million.  Ongoing  operating  profit
increased $41 million  reflecting  higher volume gains  (reported by most of our
business  units) and lower G&A  expenses,  due in part to savings  from our 1996
restructuring. These gains were partially reduced by higher A&M.

Tropicana
- ---------

The standard measure of volume is four-gallon equivalent cases.

In its first full year as part of  PepsiCo,  net sales were  $2.25  billion  and
operating  profit was $170 million for 1999. For the period August 26, 1998 (the
date of acquisition)  through December 26, 1998, net sales were $722 million and
operating  profit was $40  million.  This 18 week period in 1998 was reported in
the fourth  quarter  and,  therefore,  is not  comparable  to the 16 week fourth
quarter of 1999.  Including the impact of the  additional two weeks in 1998, net
sales decreased 2% and operating  profit  increased 35%. On a comparable 16 week
basis,  net sales and  operating  profit  increased  10% and 55%,  respectively.
Volume for the fiscal year 1999 increased 4%, led by an 8% increase in Tropicana
Pure Premium worldwide.  Higher pricing taken to offset increases in the cost of
oranges, combined with volume growth, drove 1999 operating performance.

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS

1999 vs. 1998
- -------------

Our 1999 consolidated cash and cash equivalents  increased $653 million compared
to a $1.6 billion decrease in 1998. The change primarily  reflects a decrease in
cash outflows for acquisitions and investments in  unconsolidated  affiliates as
compared to 1998,  which included the acquisition of Tropicana,  and lower share
repurchase activity in 1999. In addition, cash and cash equivalents increased as
a result of net  proceeds  from  long-term  debt  financings  in 1999  primarily
related to the PBG separation,  versus net payments in 1998.  These  comparative
increases  were  partially  offset by net payments of  short-term  borrowings in
1999,  primarily  funded from amounts  received from PBG,  versus net short-term
borrowings in 1998 and the  comparative  impact of net  maturities of short-term
investments in 1998.

1998 vs. 1997
- -------------
Our 1998 consolidated cash and cash equivalents  decreased $1.6 billion compared
to a $1.6 billion  increase in 1997.  Excluding  cash  provided by  discontinued
operations in 1997, the decrease in cash and cash  equivalents  was $1.6 billion
in 1998 compared with a $4.6 billion  decrease in 1997.  The change in cash flow
primarily  reflects net proceeds  from issuance of debt and the  liquidation  of
investment  portfolios  in 1998 compared to net debt  repayments in 1997.  These
cash  inflows  were  primarily  used to fund  acquisitions  and  investments  in
unconsolidated  affiliates  during the year. The acquisitions and investments in
unconsolidated  affiliates  include the  purchases of  Tropicana,  the remaining
ownership  interest in various  bottlers,  TSSC and various other  international
salty snack food businesses.

Share Repurchases
- -----------------
Our share repurchase activity was as follows:

                                                   1999        1998        1997
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cost                                             $1,285      $2,230      $2,459
Shares repurchased
   Number of shares (in millions)                  35.8        59.2        69.0
   % of shares outstanding at beginning of year     2.4%        3.9%        4.5%

The  current  authorization  for  share  repurchases  granted  by our  Board  of
Directors is $3 billion over the three year period from 1999 to 2001.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We reduced our revolving credit facilities to $1.5 billion in 1999. Of the $4.75
billion as of year-end  1998,  $3.1 billion  expired  March 26, 1999 and was not
renewed due to our reduced  borrowing  needs.  The  remaining  $1.65 billion was
cancelled on June 18, 1999 and replaced with a $600 million facility expiring in
June  of  2000  and a $900  million  facility  expiring  in  June  of  2004.  At
expiration,  these facilities can be extended an additional year upon the mutual
consent of PepsiCo and the lending  institutions.  The credit  facilities  exist
largely to support  issuances of  short-term  debt and remain unused at year-end
1999. At year-end 1999, $900 million of short-term  borrowings were reclassified
as long-term,  reflecting  our intent and ability,  through the existence of the
unused credit facilities, to refinance these borrowings.

As discussed  in Note 2, our Board of Directors  approved a plan in 1998 for the
separation  from  PepsiCo of PBG.  PBG  completed  an IPO on April 6,  1999.  In
February and March of 1999,  in  preparation  for the IPO, PBG and its principal
operating   subsidiary,   Bottling  Group,   LLC,   incurred  $6.55  billion  of
indebtedness.  Of the $6.55  billion,  $3.25  billion was repaid by PBG with the
proceeds  of  the  IPO  and  the  issuance  of  long-term   debt.   PepsiCo  has
unconditionally  guaranteed $2.3 billion of Bottling Group,  LLC long-term debt.
During the first quarter, we received $5.5 billion of the debt proceeds obtained
by PBG primarily as settlement of pre-existing  intercompany  amounts due to us.
These  proceeds  were  used to repay  our  short-term  borrowings  and for share
repurchases.

The Whitman transaction,  completed on May 20, 1999, generated net cash proceeds
of $300 million.


The  deconsolidation of the PBG, PBO and PepCom operations  resulted in declines
in current  assets,  intangible  assets,  property,  plant and  equipment,  net,
current  liabilities,  long-term debt and deferred income taxes, and an increase
in investments in unconsolidated affiliates.

Our strong  cash-generating  capability  and financial  condition  give us ready
access to capital markets throughout the world.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(tabular  dollars  in  millions  except  per share  amounts;  all per share
amounts  assume dilution)

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The  preparation of the  consolidated  financial  statements in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets,  liabilities,  revenues,
expenses and  disclosure of contingent  assets and  liabilities.  Actual results
could differ from these estimates.

Items Affecting Comparability

Certain  reclassifications  were made to the 1998 and 1997 amounts to conform to
the 1999 presentation, particularly the segment reclassifications resulting from
the 1999  reorganization of our Pepsi-Cola  business  described in Note 18. As a
result of the 1999 bottling  transactions  described in Note 2, certain bottling
operations  that were  previously  consolidated  are now accounted for under the
equity method.  Therefore,  the consolidated  financial statements subsequent to
the bottling  transactions  are not  comparable  to the  consolidated  financial
statements  presented  for prior  periods.  In addition,  the third quarter 1998
acquisition of Tropicana described in Note 3 affects comparability.

Principles of Consolidation

The financial statements include the consolidated  accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and
its controlled  affiliates.  Intercompany  balances and  transactions  have been
eliminated.  Investments in  unconsolidated  affiliates,  over which we exercise
significant influence,  but not control, are accounted for by the equity method.
Accordingly,  our  share  of the net  income  or  loss  of  such  unconsolidated
affiliates is included in consolidated net income.

Issuances of Subsidiary Stock

The issuance of stock by one of our  subsidiaries  to third parties  reduces our
proportionate ownership interest in the subsidiary.  Unless the issuance of such
stock is part of a broader  corporate  reorganization,  we  recognize  a gain or
loss,  equal to the  difference  between  the  issuance  price per share and our
carrying  amount  per  share.  Such gain or loss,  net of the  related  tax,  is
recognized in consolidated net income when the transaction occurs.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize  revenue  when  products are  delivered to  customers.  Sales terms
generally do not allow a right to return.

Marketing Costs

Marketing costs are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses and
include  costs  of  advertising  and  other  marketing  activities.  Advertising
expenses  were $1.8  billion in 1999,  $1.9  billion in 1998 and $1.8 billion in
1997.  Deferred  advertising  expense,  classified  as prepaid  expenses  in the
Consolidated  Balance  Sheet,  was $30  million in 1999 and $34 million in 1998.
Deferred advertising  costs are expensed in the year first used and consist of:
o media and personal service prepayments,
o promotional materials in inventory, and
o production costs of future media advertising.
                                            F-9


<PAGE>


Stock-Based Compensation

We measure  stock-based  compensation  cost as the  excess of the quoted  market
price of PepsiCo  Capital  Stock at the grant date over the amount the  employee
must pay for the stock (exercise price).  Our policy is to generally grant stock
options with an exercise price equal to the stock price at the date of grant and
accordingly,  no compensation cost is recognized.  Under our incentive programs,
compensation  cost for  performance  share units  granted and for cash  payments
expected to be paid to employees in lieu of stock  options is based on the grant
date value and recognized over the vesting period of the award.

Derivative Instruments

The  interest  differential  to be paid or received on an interest  rate swap is
recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as the differential  occurs.  If
an interest rate swap position were to be terminated,  the gain or loss realized
upon  termination  would be deferred and amortized to interest  expense over the
remaining  term of the  underlying  debt  instrument  it was intended to modify.
However, if the underlying debt instrument were to be settled prior to maturity,
the gain or loss realized upon termination would be recognized immediately.

The  differential  to be paid or received on a currency swap related to non-U.S.
dollar  denominated  debt  is  charged  or  credited  to  selling,  general  and
administrative  expenses as the differential occurs. This is fully offset by the
corresponding  gain or loss recognized on the currency  translation of the debt,
as  both  amounts  are  based  upon  the  same  exchange  rates.   The  currency
differential  not yet settled in cash is reflected in the  Consolidated  Balance
Sheet under the appropriate current or noncurrent receivable or payable caption.
If a currency swap position were to be terminated prior to maturity, the gain or
loss  realized  upon  termination  would be  immediately  recognized in selling,
general and administrative expenses.

Gains and losses on futures  contracts  designated as hedges of future commodity
purchases are deferred in the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet under the appropriate
current  asset or  liability  caption  and  included  in the cost of the  hedged
commodity when  purchased.  Changes in the value of such contracts used to hedge
commodity  purchases  are highly  correlated  to the changes in the value of the
purchased  commodity.  Subsequent  changes in the value of such  contracts  that
cease to be highly  correlated or changes in the value of futures  contracts not
designated  as hedges would be  recognized  in cost of sales  immediately.  If a
futures contract  designated as a hedge were to be terminated,  the gain or loss
realized upon termination  would be included in the cost of the hedged commodity
when purchased.

Prepaid  forward  contracts  for the  purchase  of  PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  are
reflected in the Consolidated  Balance Sheet at fair value as a prepaid expense.
Changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized as interest expense.

The cash flows related to the above derivative instruments are classified in the
Consolidated  Statement of Cash Flows in a manner  consistent  with those of the
transactions being hedged.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents  represent funds temporarily  invested with original maturities
of  three  months  or  less.  All  other  investment  portfolios  are  primarily
classified as short-term investments.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (computed on the average,  first-in,
first-out or last-in, first-out method) or net realizable value.
                                            F-10

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property,  plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on
a straight-line  basis.  Buildings and  improvements  are depreciated over their
estimated  useful lives,  generally  ranging from 20 to 50 years.  Machinery and
equipment  (including  fleet) are depreciated over their estimated useful lives,
generally ranging from 2 to 10 years.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill,  the excess of our investments in  unconsolidated  affiliates over our
equity in the underlying assets of these investments,  and reacquired  franchise
rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives,
generally  ranging  from  20 to 40  years.  Trademarks  and  other  identifiable
intangibles are amortized on a straight-line  basis over their estimated  useful
lives, generally ranging from 20 to 40 years.

Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets to be Held and Used in the Business

All  long-lived  assets,  including  goodwill,   investments  in  unconsolidated
affiliates and other identifiable  intangibles,  are evaluated for impairment on
the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate  that the  carrying  amount  of an  asset  may not be  recoverable.  An
impaired  asset is written down to its estimated  fair market value based on the
best information available. Estimated fair market value is generally measured by
discounting  estimated future cash flows.  Considerable  management  judgment is
necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows.

The  depreciation or amortization  periods for long-lived  assets to be held and
used are  periodically  evaluated to determine  whether events or  circumstances
have occurred that warrant revision.

Accounting Changes

As of December 28, 1997, we adopted  Statement of Position 98-1,  Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, issued by
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in March 1998. The amount
capitalized under the SOP was $52 million in 1999 and $42 million in 1998.

In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging  Activities.  SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 137, is effective for our
fiscal year  beginning  2001.  SFAS 133  establishes  accounting  and  reporting
standards for derivative  instruments,  including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other  contracts,  and for hedging  activities.  It requires that we
recognize all  derivative  instruments  as either assets or  liabilities  in the
Consolidated  Balance Sheet and measure those  instruments at fair value. We are
currently  assessing  the effects of adopting  SFAS 133, and have not yet made a
determination  of the impact  adoption will have on our  consolidated  financial
statements.

Note 2 - Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

In 1998, our Board of Directors  approved a plan for the separation from PepsiCo
of certain  wholly-owned  bottling  businesses  located  in the  United  States,
Canada, Spain, Greece and Russia, referred to as The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG).
On April 6, 1999, PBG completed the sale of 100 million shares of its


                                            F-11


<PAGE>


common stock at $23 per share  through an initial  public  offering with PepsiCo
retaining a direct noncontrolling  ownership interest of 35.5%. During the first
quarter,  we received $5.5 billion of debt proceeds obtained by PBG primarily as
settlement  of  pre-existing  intercompany  amounts due to us. We  recognized  a
pre-tax gain of $1.0 billion ($476 million  after-tax or $0.32 per share) in the
second quarter.

On May 20, 1999,  we combined  certain  bottling  operations  in the  midwestern
United States and Central Europe (PBO) with the Whitman Corporation,  a publicly
traded  corporation,  to  create  new  Whitman.  We  retained  a  noncontrolling
ownership interest of approximately 38% in new Whitman. The transaction resulted
in an after-tax loss to PepsiCo of $206 million or $0.14 per share.

On July 10, 1999, we formed a business venture with PepCom  Industries,  Inc., a
Pepsi-Cola franchisee,  combining bottling businesses in parts of North Carolina
and New York.  PepCom  contributed  bottling  operations  in central and eastern
North Carolina and in Long Island,  New York to the venture.  We contributed our
bottling operations in Winston-Salem and Wilmington,  North Carolina in exchange
for a  noncontrolling  interest in the venture,  Pepsi Bottling  Venture LLC, of
35%.  The  transaction  was  accounted  for as a  nonmonetary  exchange for book
purposes.  A portion of the transaction was taxable which resulted in income tax
expense of $25 million or $0.02 per share.

On October 15,  1999,  we formed a business  venture  with Pohlad  Companies,  a
Pepsi-Cola franchisee, combining bottling businesses in Puerto Rico and parts of
the southeastern and midwestern United States.  Pohlad Companies contributed its
interests in Dakota Beverage  Company,  Delta Beverage Group,  Inc.  (Delta) and
Pepsi-Cola  Puerto Rico Bottling  Company (PPR). We contributed our interests in
Delta and PPR as well as 2.2 million shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock in exchange
for a 33%  noncontrolling  interest  in the  venture.  As a  result,  we  have a
noncontrolling   ownership  interest  of  approximately  24%  in  the  venture's
principal  operating   subsidiary,   PepsiAmericas,   Inc.,  a  publicly  traded
corporation. The Pohlad transaction was structured as a fair value exchange with
no resulting gain or loss.

Pepsi Bottling Group

The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. is the world's largest manufacturer,  distributor
and seller of carbonated and  non-carbonated  Pepsi-Cola  beverages and operates
under master bottling  agreements with us. In addition to  approximately  37% of
PBG's  outstanding  common  stock that we now own,  we own 100% of PBG's class B
common stock and  approximately  7% of the equity of Bottling Group,  LLC, PBG's
principal   operating   subsidiary.   This  gives  us  economic   ownership   of
approximately  40% of PBG's combined  operations.  We account for our investment
using the equity method.

Related Party Transactions


Our  significant   related  party   transactions   involve  our  investments  in
unconsolidated bottling affiliates. We sell concentrate to these affiliates that
is  used  in  the  production  of  carbonated  soft  drinks  and  non-carbonated
beverages.  They purchase sweeteners and certain other raw materials through us.
The raw  material  purchases  on behalf of these  bottling  affiliates,  related
payments to suppliers and collections from the bottlers are not reflected in our
consolidated  financial statements.  We also provide certain  administrative and
other services to these bottling affiliates under negotiated fee arrangements.

Further, because we share a business objective with these bottling affiliates of
increasing the availability and consumption of Pepsi-Cola beverages,  we provide
various  forms of  marketing  support  to or on  behalf of them to  promote  our
beverages.  This support covers a variety of initiatives,  including marketplace
support,  marketing  programs,  capital  equipment  investment  and shared media
expense.  Based on the  objective  of the programs  and  initiatives,  we record
marketing  support as an adjustment  to net revenues or as selling,  general and
administrative expense.

These transactions with our unconsolidated  bottling affiliates are reflected in
the Consolidated Statement of Income as follows:

As of December 25, 1999, the receivables from these bottling  affiliates are $93
million and  payables to these  affiliates  are $131  million.  Such amounts are
settled in terms  consistent with other trade  receivable and payable terms. See
Note 13 regarding our guarantee of PBG related debt.

Note 3 - Acquisitions

During 1999, we made  acquisitions,  primarily  investments in various  bottlers
including  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates,  which  aggregated  $430
million in cash.

During 1998, we completed the acquisitions of Tropicana Products,  Inc. from The
Seagram Company Ltd. for $3.3 billion in cash and The Smith's Snackfoods Company
(TSSC) in Australia from United Biscuits  Holdings plc for $270 million in cash.
In  addition  during  1998,   acquisitions  and  investments  in  unconsolidated
affiliates  included the remaining  ownership  interest in various  bottlers and
purchases  of  various  other   international   salty  snack  food   businesses.
Acquisitions for 1998 aggregated $4.5 billion in cash.

The  results  of  operations  of  acquisitions  are  generally  included  in the
consolidated  financial  statements from their  respective dates of acquisition.
The  acquisitions  were  accounted for under the purchase  method.  The purchase
prices  have been  allocated  based on the  estimated  fair  value of the assets
acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.  The excess  purchase  prices over the fair
values of the net assets acquired of approximately $310 million in 1999 and $3.2
billion in 1998 were allocated to goodwill.

Unaudited Tropicana Pro Forma

The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of PepsiCo
and Tropicana as if the  acquisition had occurred at the beginning of our fiscal
years 1998 and 1997. The aggregate impact of other acquisitions in these periods

1999

The 1999 asset impairment and restructuring  charge of $65 million recognized in
the first  quarter  relates to the  closure of three  plants and  impairment  of
equipment  at  Frito-Lay  North  America.  This charge was the second phase of a
productivity  improvement plan developed in the fourth quarter of 1998. The plan
included the consolidation of U.S. production to newer and more efficient plants
and streamlining logistics and transportation systems.


                                            F-16


<PAGE>


The asset  impairment  charges  primarily  reflect the reduction in the carrying
value of the land and  buildings to their  estimated  fair market value based on
current selling prices for comparable  real estate,  less costs to sell, and the
write off of the net book value of  equipment  which cannot be  redeployed.  The
plant  closures were  completed  during 1999.  The majority of these assets were
either  disposed  of or  abandoned  in 1999.  The  restructuring  charges of $28
million primarily  included  severance costs for approximately 860 employees and
plant closing costs. Substantially all of the terminations occurred during 1999.

1998

The 1998  asset  impairment  and  restructuring  charges  of $288  million  were
comprised of the following:

o  A  charge  of $218  million  for  asset  impairment  of $200  million  and
   restructuring  charges  of  $18  million  related  to  our  Russian  bottling
   operations.  The economic turmoil in Russia which accompanied the August 1998
   devaluation of the ruble adversely impacted our operations.  Consequently, we
   experienced  a significant  drop in demand,  resulting in lower net sales and
   increased  operating  losses.  Also,  since net bottling sales in Russia were
   denominated in rubles, whereas a substantial portion of our related costs and
   expenses were denominated in U.S.  dollars,  bottling  operating margins were
   further  eroded.  In  response  to  these  conditions,  we  reduced  our cost
   structure primarily through closing facilities,  renegotiating  manufacturing
   contracts  and  reducing  the  number of  employees.  We also  evaluated  our
   long-lived  bottling  assets for  impairment,  triggered by the  reduction in
   utilization  of assets caused by the lower demand,  the adverse change in the
   business  climate and the expected  continuation of operating losses and cash
   deficits in that market.  The impairment charge reduced the net book value of
   the assets to their  estimated fair market value,  based primarily on amounts
   recently paid for similar assets in that marketplace.  Of the total charge of
   $218 million, $212 million related to bottling operations that became part of
   PBG in 1999 (see Note 2).

o  An impairment  charge of $54 million related to  manufacturing  equipment at
   Frito-Lay North America.  As part of our annual assessment of marketing plans
   and related capacity requirements  at  Frito-Lay  North  America and the
   development of a program to improve manufacturing productivity, we determined
   that certain product specific equipment would not be utilized and certain
   capital projects would be terminated to avoid  production redundancies.  The
   charge primarily  reflected the write off of the net book value of the
   equipment and related  projects.  Disposal or abandonment of these assets was
   completed in 1999.

o  A charge  of $16  million  for  employee  related  costs  resulting  from the
   separation   of  Pepsi-Cola   North   America's   concentrate   and  bottling
   organizations  to more  effectively  serve  retail  customers in light of the
   conversion  of PBG to public  ownership  (see Note 2).  Of this  amount,  $10
   million related to bottling operations that became part of PBG in 1999.

The employee related costs for 1998 of $24 million primarily  included severance
and relocation costs for  approximately  2,700 employees  located in the Russian
bottling plants and at Pepsi-Cola  North America field  locations.  During 1998,
approximately 2,600 of the terminations occurred most of which were terminations
of part-time  employees with little associated cost. The remaining  terminations
either  occurred in 1999 or related to the bottling  operations that became part
of PBG in 1999.

1997

The 1997  asset  impairment  and  restructuring  charges  of $290  million  were
comprised of the following:

o  Net  charges of $183 million  in  several of our  business  segments  for net
   asset impairment  of  $150  million  related  to  the  planned   disposal  of
   assets and for restructuring charges of $33 million.  The impairment  charges
   were taken as a result of decisions  to  dispose  of  certain   company-owned
   bottling  operations  and  non-core international  businesses,  to dispose of
   certain  assets to improve the  utilization  of facilities and to reduce
   occupancy costs and to exit certain bottling joint ventures.  The  impairment
   charges reduced the net book value of these assets to their  estimated fair
   market value,  generally based on estimates  developed  internally or, if
   available, amounts paid for similar assets, less costs to sell. The disposals
   occurred in 1997 and 1998 and in connection with the separation of certain
   company-owned  bottling operations (see Note 2). The restructuring  charges
   primarily  related to the  reorganization of an international company-owned
   bottling operation.

o  Charges of $94 million for asset impairment of $48 million and  restructuring
   charges of $46 million  related  to  productivity  initiatives  in  worldwide
   snacks.  These initiatives  included  closing plants, eliminating  production
   lines and  consolidating distribution  facilities.  The resulting impairment
   charges were recognized primarily for assets held for disposal or abandonment
   and  reduced  the net book value of impaired assets to their  estimated  fair
   market  value,  generally  based on estimates  developed internally  or, if
   available, amounts  paid for  similar  assets, less  costs to sell.  Disposal
   or  abandonment of these assets was  substantially  completed  in 1997,  with
   a significant portion of the remainder completed in 1998 as planned.

o  Net  charges of $13 million  for net asset  impairment  of $2 million and net
   restructuring  charges of $11 million  related to actions to  strengthen  our
   international  bottling  structure.  Restructuring  charges  of  $98  million
   consisted  of third  party  termination  payments  related  to  refranchising
   bottling  operations and our  investments in bottling joint  ventures.  These
   charges were substantially offset by an arbitration settlement of $87 million
   which  we  were  awarded  as a  result  of the  termination  of the  bottling
   appointment with our previous Venezuelan bottler.

The employee related costs for 1997 of $55 million primarily  included severance
and relocation  costs for  approximately  2,100 employees  primarily  located in
international  plants and  distribution  centers.  During 1997,  terminations of
approximately   1,100  employees  occurred  and,  in  1998,   approximately  500
terminations  occurred. As a result of the successful  redeployment of employees
to other  locations,  approximately  500  terminations  did not occur as planned
which resulted in a change of estimate in 1998.

The  restructuring  reserves are included in accounts  payable and other current
liabilities in the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet. At year-end 1999, the remaining
liability   for   restructuring   charges   associated   with   investments   in
unconsolidated  affiliates  was  $10  million  related  to  indemnifications  of
litigation liabilities.

The remaining carrying amounts of assets held for disposal were $6 million as of
December  25,  1999,  $13 million as of December  26, 1998 and $60 million as of
December  27,  1997.  During  1998 and 1997,  the net sales  from  international
bottling  business  units held for disposal  were $202 million and $590 million,
respectively. Such businesses generated operating profits of $20 million in 1998
and $42 million in 1997. Our investments in  unconsolidated  affiliates held for
disposal  provided  break-even  results in 1999 and losses of $2 million in 1998
and $5 million in 1997.

Note 5 - Discontinued Operations

The restaurants segment was composed of the core restaurant  businesses of Pizza
Hut,  Taco Bell and  Kentucky  Fried  Chicken,  PepsiCo Food  Systems  (PFS),  a
restaurant  distribution   operation,   and  several  non-core  U.S.  restaurant
businesses.  In 1997, we spun off the restaurant  businesses to our shareholders
as an  independent  publicly  traded  company  (Distribution).  The spin-off was
effective as a tax-free  Distribution  on October 6, 1997  (Distribution  Date).
Owners of PepsiCo  Capital  Stock as of September 19, 1997 received one share of
common stock of Tricon Global Restaurants,  Inc., the new company,  for every 10
shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock.  Immediately  before the Distribution  Date, we
received  $4.5 billion in cash from Tricon as  repayment of certain  amounts due
and a dividend. PFS and the non-core U.S. restaurant businesses were sold before
the Distribution Date resulting in after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $1.0
billion.

Note 6 - Income Per Share

We present two income per share measures,  basic and assuming  dilution,  on the
face of the  Consolidated  Statement of Income.  "Basic" income per share equals
net income  divided by weighted  average  common shares  outstanding  during the
period.  Income per share "assuming  dilution"  equals net income divided by the
sum of weighted average common shares  outstanding during the period plus common
stock equivalents, such as stock options.

The  following  reconciles  shares  outstanding  at the beginning of the year to
average shares outstanding:

The weighted  average  interest  rates in the above table include the effects of
associated interest rate and currency swaps at year-end 1999 and 1998. Also, see
Note 13 for a discussion  of our use of interest  rate and currency  swaps,  our
management  of the inherent  credit risk and fair value  information  related to
debt and interest rate and currency swaps.

Interest Rate Swaps

The following table indicates the notional amount and weighted  average interest
rates,  by category,  of interest  rate swaps  outstanding  at year-end 1999 and
1998.  The  weighted  average  variable  interest  rates that we pay,  which are
primarily  linked to either  commercial paper or LIBOR rates, are based on rates
as of the respective balance sheet date and are subject to change.

    Weighted average pay rate......       6.1%        5.3%

</TABLE>

The terms of the  interest  rate swaps match the terms of the debt they  modify.
The  swaps   terminate  at  various  dates  through  2013.  At  year-end   1999,
approximately  67% of  total  debt,  including  the  effects  of the  associated
interest rate swaps, was exposed to variable interest rates,  compared to 83% in
1998. In addition to variable rate long-term  debt, all debt with  maturities of
less than one year is categorized as variable for purposes of this measure.

Currency Swaps

We enter into currency swaps to hedge our currency  exposure on certain non-U.S.
dollar  denominated  debt upon issuance of such debt.  The terms of the currency
swaps match the terms of the debt they modify.  The currency swaps  terminate at
various dates through 2001.

<PAGE>


At year-end  1999,  the aggregate  carrying  amount of the debt was $244 million
denominated  in Swiss francs,  Luxembourg  francs and  Australian  dollars.  The
payables  under  related  currency  swaps  were  $62  million,  resulting  in an
effective U.S. dollar liability of $306 million with a weighted average interest
rate of 6.3%, including the effects of related interest rate swaps.

At year-end  1998,  the aggregate  carrying  amount of the debt was $678 million
denominated  in Japanese yen,  Swiss francs,  Luxembourg  francs and  Australian
dollars.  The  receivables  and payables  under related  currency  swaps were $1
million and $70 million, respectively,  resulting in a net effective U.S. dollar
liability  of $747  million  with a  weighted  average  interest  rate of  5.3%,
including the effects of related interest rate swaps.

Revolving Credit Facilities

As of year-end 1999, we maintained a $600 million facility expiring in June 2000
and a $900 million facility expiring in June 2004. These credit facilities exist
largely to support  issuances of short-term debt and remained unused at year-end
1999. At expiration,  these  facilities can be extended an additional  year upon
the mutual consent of PepsiCo and the lending institutions. These facilities are
subject to normal banking terms and conditions.

The current reclassification of short-term borrowings to long-term debt reflects
our intent and ability,  through the existence of the unused credit  facilities,
to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis.

Long-term debt  outstanding at December 25, 1999,  matures as follows during the
next five years:

Note 13 - Financial Instruments

Derivative Financial Instruments

Our policy prohibits the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes and we have  procedures  in place to monitor and control their use. The
following  discussion  excludes  futures  contracts  used to hedge our commodity
purchases.

Our use of derivative  financial  instruments  is primarily  limited to interest
rate and currency swaps, which are used to reduce borrowing costs by effectively
modifying the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. These swaps
are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt they are intended to
modify.  The notional  amount,  interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps
match the  principal,  interest  payment and maturity dates of the related debt.
Accordingly, any market risk or opportunity associated with these swaps is fully
offset by the  opposite  market  impact on the  related  debt.  Our credit  risk
related to interest rate and currency swaps is considered low because such swaps
are entered into only with strong  creditworthy  counterparties,  are  generally
settled on a net basis and are of relatively short duration.  Further,  there is
no significant  concentration with counterparties.  See Note 12 for the notional
amounts, related interest rates and maturities of the interest rate and currency
swaps.

At  year-end   1999,  we  have  equity   derivative   contracts  with  financial
institutions  in the  notional  amount of $52  million.  These  prepaid  forward
contracts hedge a portion of our deferred compensation  liability which is based
on  PepsiCo's  stock price.  During 1999,  the change in the fair value of these
contracts resulted in $6 million of expense.

The above carrying amounts are included in the Consolidated  Balance Sheet under
the indicated  captions,  except for combined  currency and interest rate swaps,
which are included in the appropriate  current or noncurrent  asset or liability
caption.  Short-term  investments  consist primarily of debt securities and have
been classified as  held-to-maturity.  Prepaid forward  contracts are classified
within prepaid expenses.

Because of the short maturity of cash  equivalents  and short-term  investments,
the  carrying  amounts  approximate  fair  values.  The fair  values of debt and
debt-related  derivative  instruments  were  estimated  using market  quotes and
calculations  based on market rates.  We have  unconditionally  guaranteed  $2.3
billion of Bottling Group,  LLC's long-term debt. The guarantee has a fair value
of $64 million based on market rates.

In 1998, we reached final  agreement  with the IRS to settle  substantially  all
remaining aspects of a tax case related to our concentrate  operations in Puerto
Rico. As a result,  we recognized a tax benefit  totaling $494 million (or $0.32
per share) which reduced our 1998 provision for income taxes.

Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between
the tax  bases of assets  or  liabilities  and  their  reported  amounts  in the
financial statements. We record the tax effect of these temporary differences as
deferred tax assets or deferred tax  liabilities.  Deferred tax assets generally
represent  items that can be used as a tax  deduction or credit in future years.
Deferred  tax  liabilities  generally  represent  items that we have taken a tax
deduction  for,  but have not yet  recorded  in the  Consolidated  Statement  of
Income.

Deferred tax liabilities are not recognized for temporary differences related to
investments in foreign  subsidiaries and in  unconsolidated  foreign  affiliates
that are  essentially  permanent in  duration.  It would not be  practicable  to
determine the amount of any such deferred tax liabilities.

Valuation  allowances  have been  established for deferred tax assets related to
net operating  losses in certain state and foreign tax  jurisdictions  where the
amount of expected  future taxable income from  operations  does not support the
recognition of these deferred tax assets.

Net operating losses of $2.7 billion for year-end 1999 are being carried forward
and are available to reduce future taxable income of certain  subsidiaries  in a
number of foreign  and state  jurisdictions.  These net  operating  losses  will
expire as follows:  $.1 billion in 2000,  $2.3  billion  between  2001 and 2015,
while $.3 billion may be carried forward indefinitely.

Note 15 - Employee Stock Options

Stock  options have been granted to employees  under three  different  incentive
plans:
o the  SharePower  Stock  Option  Plan  (SharePower),
o the  Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and
o the Stock Option Incentive Plan (SOIP).

SharePower

SharePower  stock options are granted to  essentially  all full-time  employees.
SharePower options generally have a 10 year term.  Beginning in 1998, the number
of SharePower  options granted is based on each  employee's  annual earnings and
tenure and generally become  exercisable  after three years.  Prior to 1998, the
number of options  granted  was based on each  employee's  annual  earnings  and
generally became exercisable ratably over five years.

SOIP and LTIP Since 1998

Beginning in 1998, all executive  (including middle  management) awards are made
under the LTIP. Under the LTIP, an executive  generally  receives an award based
on a multiple of base salary.  Two-thirds of the award consists of stock options
with an  exercise  price  equal to the  average  stock  price on the date of the
award.  These options generally become exercisable at the end of three years and
have a 10 year term. At the date of the award, the executive selects whether the
remaining  one-third  of the award will be  granted in stock  options or paid in
cash at the end of three  years.  The  number  of  options  granted  or the cash
payment,  if any, will depend on the attainment of prescribed  performance goals
over the three year measurement  period. If the executive chooses stock options,
they are granted with an exercise  price equal to the average stock price on the
date of the grant,  vest  immediately  and have a 10 year term. If the executive
chooses a cash  payment,  one  dollar of cash will be  received  for every  four
dollars of the award.  Amounts  expensed for expected  cash  payments were $17.9
million in 1999 and $7 million in 1998.  At year-end  1999,  135 million  shares
were available for grants under the LTIP.

SOIP and LTIP Prior to 1998

Prior to 1998, SOIP options were granted to middle management employees and were
exercisable  after one year.  LTIP  options  were  granted to senior  management
employees and were generally  exercisable  after four years.  Both SOIP and LTIP
options have 10 year terms. Certain LTIP options could be exchanged by employees
for a specified  number of performance  share units (PSUs) within 60 days of the
grant  date.  The value of a PSU was fixed at the stock  price at the grant date
and the PSU was  payable  four  years  from  the  grant  date,  contingent  upon
attainment of prescribed  performance  goals.  At year-end 1999,  1998 and 1997,
there were 68,000, 84,000 and 801,000 PSUs outstanding, respectively. Payment of
PSUs is made in cash and/or in stock as approved by the  Compensation  Committee
of our Board of Directors.  Amounts  expensed for PSUs were $.3 million in 1999,
$1 million in 1998 and $4 million in 1997.

(a)  Effective  on the date of the Tricon  spin-off,  unvested  PepsiCo  Capital
     Stock  options  held by Tricon  employees  were  converted  to Tricon stock
     options.
(b)  Immediately  following the spin-off,  the number of options were  increased
     and exercise  prices were  decreased (the  "modification")  to preserve the
     economic value of those options that existed just prior to the spin-off for
     the holders of PepsiCo Capital Stock options.
(c)  In  connection  with  the  bottling  transactions   discussed  in  Note  2,
     substantially all non-vested PepsiCo Capital Stock options held by bottling
     employees vested. The acceleration resulted in a $46 million pre-tax charge
     included in the determination of the related net gain.

The pro  forma  amounts  disclosed  above are not  fully  representative  of the
effects of stock-based awards because,  except for the impact resulting from the
bottling transactions and Tricon modification, the amounts exclude the pro forma
cost related to the unvested stock options granted before 1995.

The fair value of the options granted  (including the modification) is estimated
using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model based on the following  weighted

Note 16 - Pension and Postretirement Benefits

In 1998,  we  adopted  the  revised  disclosure  requirements  of  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 132, Employers'  Disclosures about Pensions
and Other  Postretirement  Benefits.  SFAS 132  standardized  the disclosures of
pensions and other  postretirement  benefits into a combined  format but did not
change  the  accounting  for  these  benefits.  Information  for  1997  has been
reclassified to conform to the revised disclosure
format.

Pension Benefits

Our pension plans cover  substantially all full-time U.S.  employees and certain
international  employees.  Benefits  depend on years of service and earnings are
based on stated amounts for each year of service.

Postretirement Benefits

Our postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits principally
to U.S.  retirees and their  dependents.  Employees are eligible for benefits if
they meet age and service requirements and qualify for retirement benefits.

As a result of the  bottling  transactions  described in Note 2, $717 million of
pension benefit obligation and $205 million of postretirement benefit obligation
were assumed by bottling  affiliates.  In  addition,  bottling  affiliate  plans
assumed  ownership  of $659  million  of  pension  assets.  The net  gain on the
bottling transactions includes a curtailment/settlement net loss of $52 million.

Components of Pension Assets

The pension plan assets are principally  stocks and bonds.  These assets include
approximately  6.5 million shares of PepsiCo  Capital Stock with a fair value of
$198 million in 1999 and 10.1  million  shares with a fair value of $298 million
in 1998. To maintain diversification, .5 million shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock
were sold in 1999 and 1.6 million shares were sold in 1998. In addition in 1999,
PBG pension plans  assumed  ownership of 3.1 million  shares of PepsiCo  Capital
Stock with a fair value of $95 million.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

An  average  increase  of 6.1% in the  cost of  covered  postretirement  medical
benefits is assumed for 2000 for employees who retire without cost sharing. This
average  increase is then  projected  to decline  gradually  to 5.5% in 2005 and
thereafter.

An  average  increase  of 6.0% in the  cost of  covered  postretirement  medical
benefits is assumed for 2000 for employees  who retire with cost  sharing.  This
average  increase is then  projected  to decline  gradually  to zero in 2005 and
thereafter.

Note 17 - Commitments, Contingencies and Leases

We are subject to various claims and contingencies  related to lawsuits,  taxes,
environmental  and other  matters  arising out of the normal course of business.
Contingent   liabilities  primarily  reflect  guarantees  to  support  financial
arrangements of certain unconsolidated  affiliates,  including the unconditional
guarantee for $2.3 billion of Bottling  Group,  LLC's long-term debt. We believe
that the ultimate  liability,  if any, in excess of amounts  already  recognized
arising  from such  claims or  contingencies  is not  likely to have a  material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

We have  noncancelable  commitments  under both capital and long-term  operating
leases, primarily for warehouses, distribution centers and office space. Capital
and  operating  lease  commitments  expire at various dates through 2022 and, in
many cases, provide for renewal options.  Most leases require payment of related
executory costs, which include property taxes, maintenance and insurance.

Note 18 - Business Segments

In 1998, we adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of a Business  Enterprise  and Related  Information,
which is based on management reporting.  In early 1999, in  contemplation of the
separation from PepsiCo of our bottling operations, we completed a
                                            F-33


<PAGE>


reorganization  of our Pepsi-Cola  business.  Accordingly,  our 1999  disclosure
presents  operating  results  consistent  with the new Pepsi-Cola  organization.
Prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 1999 presentation.
Therefore,  the results in 1997,  1998 and through  the  applicable  transaction
closing dates in 1999 of consolidated bottling operations in which we now own an
equity  interest are presented  separately with the 1997, 1998 and first quarter
1999 equity income or loss of other unconsolidated bottling affiliates. From the
applicable  transaction  closing  dates  in 1999,  the  equity  income  of those
previously  consolidated  bottling  operations  and the equity income or loss of
other  unconsolidated  bottling  affiliates  for the  second,  third and  fourth
quarters  of  1999  are  presented  separately  below  operating  profit  in the
Condensed  Consolidated  Statement of Income.  The combined  results of our five
reportable segments are referred to as new PepsiCo.

The North American segments include the United States and Canada.  The Tropicana
segment  includes its  international  results.  Pepsi-Cola North America results
include the North  American  concentrate  and  fountain  businesses.  Pepsi-Cola
International  results  include  the  international   concentrate  business  and
consolidated international bottling operations.

The accounting  policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note
1. All  intersegment  net  sales  and  expenses  are  immaterial  and have  been
eliminated in computing net sales and operating profit.

Management's Responsibility for Financial Statements

To Our Shareholders:

Management is  responsible  for the  reliability of the  consolidated  financial
statements  and  related  notes.  The  financial  statements  were  prepared  in
conformity  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles and include amounts
based upon our estimates and assumptions,  as required. The financial statements
have been  audited by our  independent  auditors,  KPMG LLP, who were given free
access to all  financial  records and  related  data,  including  minutes of the
meetings of the Board of Directors and Committees of the Board.  We believe that
our representations to the independent auditors are valid and appropriate.

Management   maintains  a  system  of  internal  controls  designed  to  provide
reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the financial statements,  as well
as to  safeguard  assets from  unauthorized  use or  disposition.  The system is
supported by formal policies and procedures, including an active Code of Conduct
program intended to ensure employees adhere to the highest standards of personal
and professional integrity.  Our internal audit function monitors and reports on
the adequacy of and compliance with the internal control system, and appropriate
actions  are  taken  to  address  significant  control  deficiencies  and  other
opportunities  for  improving  the  system  as they are  identified.  The  Audit
Committee of the Board of  Directors  consists  solely of directors  who are not
salaried  employees and who are, in the opinion of the Board of Directors,  free
from any  relationship  that would  interfere  with the exercise of  independent
judgment as a committee member. The Committee meets several times each year with
representatives  of management,  including internal auditors and the independent
accountants  to review our  financial  reporting  process  and our  controls  to
safeguard assets. Both our independent  auditors and internal auditors have free
access to the Audit Committee.

Although no cost-effective  internal control system will preclude all errors and
irregularities,  we  believe  our  controls  as of  December  25,  1999  provide
reasonable  assurance  that the financial  statements  are reliable and that our
assets are reasonably safeguarded.

                               Report of Independent Auditors

Board of Directors and Shareholders
PepsiCo, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and
Subsidiaries  as of  December  25,  1999 and  December  26, 1998 and the related
consolidated  statements of income, cash flows and shareholders' equity for each
of  the  years  in  the  three-year   period  ended  December  25,  1999.  These
consolidated  financial  statements are the  responsibility  of PepsiCo,  Inc.'s
management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects,  the financial  position of PepsiCo,  Inc. and
Subsidiaries  as of December 25, 1999 and December 26, 1998,  and the results of
their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year
period ended December 25, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

stock split in 1996.

                                  PEPSICO, INC
                               1987 Incentive Plan
              (as amended and restated, effective October 1, 1999)


1.       Purpose.

         The  purposes of the 1987  Incentive  Plan (the  "Plan") are to provide
long-term  incentives and rewards to those employees largely responsible for the
success  and  growth  of  PepsiCo,  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries  and  divisions
("PepsiCo"),  to assist  PepsiCo in  attracting  and retaining  executives  with
experience and ability on a basis  competitive with industry  practices,  and to
associate the interests of such employees with those of PepsiCo's shareholders.

2.       Effective Date.

         The Plan  shall  become  effective  on the date it is  approved  by the
holders of a majority of the Capital Stock of PepsiCo ("Capital Stock").
<PAGE>
3.       Administration of the Plan.

         The Plan shall be  administered  by the  Compensation  Committee of the
Board  of  Directors  of  PepsiCo  (the  "Committee").  The  Committee  shall be
appointed by the Board of Directors  and shall  consist of three or more members
of the Board who are not eligible to  participate  in the Plan and who have not,
within one year prior to their appointment,  participated in the Plan, any stock
option plan or the 1979 Incentive Plan of PepsiCo.

         The  Committee  shall have all the powers  vested in it by the terms of
the Plan,  such powers to include  exclusive  authority  (within the limitations
described  herein) to select the employees to be granted  awards under the Plan,
to  determine  the type,  size and  terms of awards to be made to each  employee
selected,  to  determine  the time when awards will be granted and to  establish
objectives  and conditions for earning awards and whether awards will be paid at
the end of the award period.  The Committee  shall have full power and authority
to  administer  and  interpret  the Plan and to adopt such  rules,  regulations,
agreements,  guidelines and instruments for the  administration  of the Plan and
for the conduct of its business as the Committee  deems  necessary or advisable.
The  Committee's  interpretations  of  the  Plan,  and  all  actions  taken  and
determinations  made  by the  Committee  pursuant  to the  powers  vested  in it
hereunder,  shall be conclusive and binding on all parties concerned,  including
PepsiCo, its shareholders and any employee of PepsiCo.




4.       Awards.

         (a) Types.  Awards under the Plan may include,  but need not be limited
to,  stock  options,  performance  shares,  incentive  stock  rights  and  stock
appreciation  rights.  The  Committee  may make any other type of award which it
shall determine is consistent with the objectives and limitations of the Plan.

         (b)  Guidelines.  The  Committee  may adopt  from time to time  written
policies for its implementation of the Plan. Such policies may include, but need
not be  limited  to,  the type,  size and term of awards to be made to  eligible
employees and the conditions for payment of such awards.

         (c) Maximum  Awards.  An employee may be granted  multiple awards under
the Plan but no one  employee  may be granted,  in the  aggregate,  awards which
would  result in his  receiving  more than 10% of the  maximum  number of shares
available for award under the Plan.

5.       Shares of Stock Subject to the Plan.

         The shares that may be delivered or purchased  under the Plan shall not
exceed  an  aggregate  of  18,000,000  shares  of  Capital  Stock.  Shares to be
delivered or purchased  under the Plan may be either  shares of  authorized  but
unissued Capital Stock or treasury shares.

6.       Deferred Payments.

         The  Committee  may  determine  that all or a portion of a payment to a
participant under the Plan,  whether it is to be made in cash, shares of Capital
Stock or a combination thereof,  shall be deferred.  Deferrals shall be for such
periods  and  upon  such  terms  as the  Committee  may  determine  in its  sole
discretion.

7.       Dilution and Other Adjustments.

         In the event of any change in the  outstanding  shares of Capital Stock
by reason of any split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation,
combination  or  exchange  of shares or other  similar  corporate  change,  such
equitable adjustments shall be made in the Plan and the awards thereunder as the
Committee determines are necessary and appropriate,  including, if necessary, an
adjustment in the maximum  number or kind of shares subject to the Plan or which
may be or have  been  awarded  to any  participant.  Such  adjustment  shall  be
conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan.




8.       Change in Control.

         At  the  date  of  a  "Change  in  Control"  (as  defined  below),  all
outstanding and unvested stock options granted under the Plan shall  immediately
vest and become  exercisable,  and all stock options then outstanding  under the
Plan shall remain  outstanding in accordance with their terms. In the event that
any stock option granted under the Plan becomes unexercisable during its term on
or after a Change in Control  because:  (i) the individual who holds such option
is  involuntarily  terminated  (other than for cause) within two (2) years after
the Change in Control;  (ii) such option is terminated or adversely modified; or
(iii) PepsiCo  Capital Stock is no longer issued and  outstanding,  or no longer
traded on a national securities  exchange,  then the holder of such option shall
immediately  be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the greater
of (x) the gain on such option or (y) the Black-Scholes value of such option (as
determined by a nationally  recognized  independent  investment banker chosen by
PepsiCo),   in  either  case   calculated  on  the  date  such  option   becomes
unexercisable.  For  purposes  of the  preceding  sentence,  the gain on a stock
option shall be calculated as the difference between the closing price per share
of PepsiCo Capital Stock as of the date such option becomes  unexercisable  less
the exercise price per share of such option.

         Any amount required to be paid pursuant to this Section 8 shall be paid
within twenty (20) days after the date such amount becomes payable.
<PAGE>
         "Change  in  Control"  means  the  occurrence  of any of the  following
events:  (i) acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding  voting securities of
PepsiCo, Inc. by another entity or group; excluding,  however, the following (A)
any acquisition by PepsiCo,  Inc., or (B) any acquisition by an employee benefit
plan or related trust sponsored or maintained by PepsiCo,  Inc.; (ii) during any
consecutive  two-year  period,  persons who constitute the Board of Directors of
PepsiCo,  Inc.  (the "Board") at the beginning of the period cease to constitute
at least 50% of the Board  (unless  the  election  of each new Board  member was
approved  by a majority  of  directors  who began the  two-year  period);  (iii)
PepsiCo,  Inc.  shareholders approve a merger or consolidation of PepsiCo,  Inc.
with another company,  and PepsiCo,  Inc. is not the surviving  company;  or, if
after such transaction,  the other entity owns,  directly or indirectly,  50% or
more of the outstanding voting securities of PepsiCo,  Inc.; (iv) PepsiCo,  Inc.
shareholders approve a plan of complete liquidation of PepsiCo, Inc. or the sale
or disposition of all or substantially all of PepsiCo, Inc.'s assets; or (v) any
other  event,  circumstance,  offer or  proposal  occurs  or is  made,  which is
intended to effect a change in the control of PepsiCo,  Inc.,  and which results
in the  occurrence of one or more of the events set forth in clauses (i) through
(iv) of this paragraph.




9.       Miscellaneous Provisions.

         (a)  Misconduct.  If the Committee  determines that a present or former
employee  has  (i)  used  for  profit  or  disclosed  to  unauthorized  persons,
confidential  information  or trade  secrets of PepsiCo,  or (ii)  breached  any
contract  with or violated any fiduciary  obligation  to PepsiCo,  that employee
shall forfeit all unpaid or undelivered portions of any awards under the Plan.

         (b) Rights as Shareholder.  A participant  under the Plan shall have no
rights as a holder of Capital Stock with respect to awards hereunder, unless and
until certificates for shares of Capital Stock are issued to the participant.

         (c)  Assignment or Transfer.  No awards under the Plan or any rights or
interests therein shall be assignable or transferable by a participant except by
will  or the  laws  of  descent  and  distribution.  During  the  lifetime  of a
participant,  awards hereunder are exercisable only by, and payable only to, the
participant.

         (d) Agreements. All awards granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by
agreements  in  such  form  and  containing   such  terms  and  conditions  (not
inconsistent with the Plan) as the Committee shall adopt.

         (e)  Requirements  for  Transfer.  No shares of Capital  Stock shall be
issued or transferred under the Plan until all legal requirements  applicable to
the  issuance  or  transfer  of  such  shares  have  been  complied  with to the
satisfaction  of the Committee.  The Committee shall have the right to condition
any  issuance  of shares of  Capital  Stock  made to any  participant  upon such
participant's  written  undertaking  to  comply  with such  restrictions  on his
subsequent  disposition  of such shares as the  Committee or PepsiCo  shall deem
necessary or advisable as a result of any applicable law, regulation or official
interpretation  thereof,  and  certificates  representing  such  shares  may  be
legended to reflect any such restrictions.
<PAGE>
         (f) Withholding Taxes.  PepsiCo shall have the right to deduct from all
awards  hereunder  paid in cash  any  federal,  state,  local or  foreign  taxes
required by law to be withheld  with respect to such awards and, with respect to
awards paid in stock or upon exercise of stock  options,  to require the payment
(through  withholding  from the  participant's  salary or otherwise) of any such
taxes.  The  obligation of PepsiCo to make delivery of awards in cash or Capital
Stock  shall be  subject  to  currency  or  other  restrictions  imposed  by any
government.

         (g) No Rights to Awards.  No  employee or other  person  shall have any
claim or right to be granted an award  under the Plan.  Neither the Plan nor any
action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any employee any right to be
retained in the employ of PepsiCo.

         (h) Costs and Expenses. The cost and expenses of administering the Plan
shall be borne by  PepsiCo  and not  charged  to any award  nor to any  employee
receiving an award.

         (i) Funding of Plan.  The Plan shall be unfunded.  PepsiCo shall not be
required  to  establish  any  special  or  separate  fund or to make  any  other
segregation of assets to assure the payment of any award under the Plan.

10.      Amendments and Termination.

         (a) Amendments. The Committee may at any time terminate or from time to
time  amend the Plan in whole or in part,  but no such  action  shall  adversely
affect any rights or  obligations  with respect to any awards  theretofore  made
under the Plan.

         Unless the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding  shares of
Capital Stock of PepsiCo shall have first approved thereof,  no amendment of the
Plan shall be effective  which would increase the maximum number of shares which
may be delivered  under the Plan or to any one  individual or extend the maximum
period during which awards may be granted under the Plan.
<PAGE>
         With the consent of the  employee  affected,  the  Committee  may amend
outstanding  agreements  evidencing  awards  under  the  Plan  in a  manner  not
inconsistent with the terms of the Plan.

                          1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan
              (as amended and restated, effective October 1, 1999)


1.       Purpose.

         The purposes of the 1994  Long-Term  Incentive Plan (the "Plan") are to
provide  long-term  incentives to those persons with significant  responsibility
for the success and growth of PepsiCo, Inc. and its subsidiaries,  divisions and
affiliated businesses ("PepsiCo"), to assist PepsiCo in attracting and retaining
key  employees on a  competitive  basis,  and to associate the interests of such
employees with those of PepsiCo's shareholders.

2.       Administration of the Plan.

         The Plan shall be  administered  by the  Compensation  Committee of the
Board  of  Directors  of  PepsiCo  (the  "Committee").  The  Committee  shall be
appointed by the Board of Directors  and shall  consist of two or more  outside,
disinterested members of the Board.

         The  Committee  shall have all the powers  vested in it by the terms of
the Plan, such powers to include  authority  (within the  limitations  described
herein) to select the persons to be granted  awards under the Plan, to determine
the type,  size and terms of awards  to be made to each  employee  selected,  to
determine the time when awards will be granted and any conditions  which must be
satisfied by employees  before an award is made,  to  establish  objectives  and
conditions for earning  awards,  to determine  whether such conditions have been
met and whether awards will be paid at the end of the award period,  or when the
award is exercised, or deferred, to determine whether payment of an award should
be reduced or eliminated,  and to determine  whether such awards should qualify,
regardless of their amount,  as deductible in their  entirety for federal income
tax purposes.

         The Committee  shall have full power and  authority to  administer  and
interpret the Plan and to adopt such rules, regulations,  agreements, guidelines
and  instruments for the  administration  of the Plan and for the conduct of its
businesses  the  Committee  deems   necessary  or  advisable.   The  Committee's
interpretations  of the Plan, and all actions taken and  determinations  made by
the Committee pursuant to the powers vested in it hereunder, shall be conclusive
and binding on all parties concerned,  including  PepsiCo,  its shareholders and
any person receiving an award under the Plan.




3.       Eligibility.

         Key employees of PepsiCo and its divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates
are eligible to be granted awards under the Plan.  Executives of PepsiCo and its
subsidiaries  and  divisions  shall  be  granted  awards  of stock  options  and
performance  units and may,  in the  Committee's  discretion,  be granted  other
awards  available  under the Plan. The Committee,  in its  discretion,  may also
grant  awards  under the Plan to other  employees  of  PepsiCo,  its  divisions,
subsidiaries  and  affiliates who are in a position to contribute to the success
of PepsiCo.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  incentive stock options may only be
granted to employees of PepsiCo or its divisions and subsidiaries.
<PAGE>
4.       Awards.

         (a) Types.  Awards under the Plan include  stock  options,  performance
units, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock.

                  (i) Stock Options. Stock options are rights to purchase shares
of PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  ("Capital  Stock") at a fixed  price for a specified
period of time. The purchase price per share of Capital Stock covered by a stock
option  awarded  pursuant to this Plan,  including any incentive  stock options,
shall be equal to or greater  than the fair  market  value of a share of PepsiCo
Capital Stock on the date the stock option is awarded.

                  (ii)  Performance  Units.  Performance  units  are  rights  to
receive  up to 100% of the value of shares  of  Capital  Stock as of the date of
grant, which value may be paid in cash or Capital Stock,  without payment of any
amounts to PepsiCo.  The full and/or partial payment of performance  unit awards
granted under this Plan will be made only upon certification by the Committee of
the  attainment  by PepsiCo,  over a four year  period,  of  earnings  per share
targets which have been established by the Committee. No payment will be made if
the minimum  earnings per share target is not met. The established  earnings per
share targets will not be amended without shareholder approval.

                  (iii) Stock Appreciation Rights. Stock appreciation rights are
rights to receive the  difference  between  the fair market  value of a share of
PepsiCo  Capital Stock on the grant date and the fair market value of a share of
Capital Stock on the date the stock appreciation right is granted.

                  (iv) Restricted  Stock. The full and/or partial vesting of any
restricted  stock award made under this Plan will occur only upon the attainment
by PepsiCo of primary and secondary targets  established by the Committee at the
time the award is made.  These targets may include one or more of the following:
corporate earnings,  return on investment,  total shareholder  return,  division
profits, market value added or economic value added.

                  (v)  Variable  Awards.  Variable  awards are rights to receive
grants of either cash payments or stock options  based upon the  performance  of
PepsiCo business units during a three-year  performance  period. The election to
receive cash or stock options is made by the participant at the beginning of the
three-year performance period.

         (b) Supplemental  Awards.  Participants who are newly hired or promoted
during the vesting period for stock options or during the first two years of the
award period for performance units will be granted  supplemental pro rata grants
of stock options and performance units.

         (c) Negative  Discretion.  Notwithstanding the attainment by PepsiCo of
any target  specified  under this Plan,  the  Committee has the  discretion,  by
participant, to reduce some or all of an award that would otherwise by paid.

         (d)  Guidelines.  The  Committee  shall adopt from time to time written
policies for its  implementation  of the Plan. Such policies shall be consistent
with the Plan and may  include,  but need not be limited to, the type,  size and
term of awards to be made, and the conditions for payment of such awards.

         (e) Maximum  Awards.  An employee may be granted  multiple awards under
the Plan but no one  employee  may be granted,  in the  aggregate,  awards which
would result in his  receiving,  in the  aggregate  during the term of the Plan,
more than 10% of the  maximum  number of shares  available  for award  under the
Plan.  Solely for the  purposes of  determining  whether  this maximum is met, a
performance  unit shall be treated as entitling the holder  thereof to one share
of PepsiCo Capital Stock.

5.       Shares of Stock Subject to the Plan.

         The shares that may be delivered or purchased  under the Plan shall not
exceed an aggregate  of  75,000,000  shares of Capital  Stock,  as adjusted,  if
appropriate, pursuant to Section 7 hereof.

6.       Deferred Payments.

         The  Committee  may  determine  that all or a portion of a payment to a
participant under the Plan,  whether it is to be made in cash, shares of Capital
Stock or a combination thereof,  shall be deferred.  Deferrals shall be for such
periods  and  upon  such  terms  as the  Committee  may  determine  in its  sole
discretion.

7.       Dilution and Other Adjustments.

         In the event of any change in the  outstanding  shares of Capital Stock
by reason of any split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation,
combination  or  exchange  of shares or other  similar  corporate  change,  such
equitable adjustments shall be made in the Plan and the awards thereunder as the
Committee determines are necessary and appropriate,  including, if necessary, an
adjustment in the maximum  number or kind of shares subject to the Plan or which

8.       Change in Control.

         Upon a "Change in Control"  (as defined  below),  the  following  shall
occur:

                  (a)  Options.  At the  date of such  Change  in  Control,  all
outstanding and unvested stock options granted under the Plan shall  immediately
vest and become  exercisable,  and all stock options then outstanding  under the
Plan shall remain  outstanding in accordance with their terms. In the event that
any stock option granted under the Plan becomes unexercisable during its term on
or after a Change in Control  because:  (i) the individual who holds such option
is  involuntarily  terminated  (other than for cause) within two (2) years after
the Change in Control;  (ii) such option is terminated or adversely modified; or
(iii) PepsiCo  Capital Stock is no longer issued and  outstanding,  or no longer
traded on a national securities  exchange,  then the holder of such option shall
immediately  be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the greater
of (x) the gain on such option or (y) the Black-Scholes value of such option (as
determined by a nationally  recognized  independent  investment banker chosen by
PepsiCo),   in  either  case   calculated  on  the  date  such  option   becomes
unexercisable.  For  purposes  of the  preceding  sentence,  the gain on a stock
option shall be calculated as the difference between the closing price per share
of PepsiCo Capital Stock as of the date such option becomes  unexercisable  less
the exercise price per share of such option.

                  (b) Variable  Awards.  Each  variable  award granted under the
Plan that is outstanding on the date of the Change in Control shall  immediately
vest,  and the holder of such award shall be entitled to a lump sum cash payment
equal to 100% of the amount of such award payable at the end of the  performance
period as if 100% of the performance objectives have been achieved.

                  (c) Performance  Shares.  Each performance share granted under
the  Plan  that is  outstanding  on the  date of the  Change  in  Control  shall
immediately  vest, and the holder of such performance share shall be entitled to
a lump sum cash payment  equal to the amount of such award payable at the end of
the  performance  period  as if 100% of the  performance  objectives  have  been
achieved.

         Any amount required to be paid pursuant to this Section 8 shall be paid
within twenty (20) days after the date such amount becomes payable.

         "Change  in  Control"  means  the  occurrence  of any of the  following
events:  (i) acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding  voting securities of
PepsiCo, Inc. by another entity or group; excluding,  however, the following (A)
any acquisition by PepsiCo,  Inc., or (B) any acquisition by an employee benefit
plan or related trust sponsored or maintained by PepsiCo,  Inc.; (ii) during any
consecutive  two-year  period,  persons who constitute the Board of Directors of
PepsiCo,  Inc.  (the "Board") at the beginning of the period cease to constitute
at least 50% of the Board  (unless  the  election  of each new Board  member was
approved  by a majority  of  directors  who began the  two-year  period);  (iii)
PepsiCo,  Inc.  shareholders approve a merger or consolidation of PepsiCo,  Inc.
with another company,  and PepsiCo,  Inc. is not the surviving  company;  or, if
after such transaction,  the other entity owns,  directly or indirectly,  50% or
more of the outstanding voting securities of PepsiCo,  Inc.; (iv) PepsiCo,  Inc.
shareholders approve a plan of complete liquidation of PepsiCo, Inc. or the sale
or disposition of all or substantially all of PepsiCo, Inc.'s assets; or (v) any
other  event,  circumstance,  offer or  proposal  occurs  or is  made,  which is
intended to effect a change in the control of PepsiCo,  Inc.,  and which results
in the  occurrence of one or more of the events set forth in clauses (i) through
(iv) of this paragraph.

9.       Miscellaneous Provisions.

         (a)  Misconduct.  If the Committee  determines that a present or former
employee  has  (i)  used  for  profit  or  disclosed  to  unauthorized  persons,
confidential  information  or trade  secrets of PepsiCo,  or (ii)  breached  any
contract  with or violated any fiduciary  obligation  to PepsiCo,  that employee
shall forfeit his or her awards under the Plan.

         (b)  Rights as  Shareholder.  A  participant  in the Plan shall have no
rights as a holder of Capital Stock with respect to awards hereunder, unless and
until certificates for shares of Capital Stock are issued to the participant.

         (c)  Assignment or Transfer.  Unless the Committee  shall  specifically
determine otherwise,  no award under the Plan or any rights or interests therein
shall be assignable or transferable by a participant  except by will or the laws
of descent and distribution.

         (d) Agreements. All awards granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by
agreements  in  such  form  and  containing   such  terms  and  conditions  (not
inconsistent with the Plan) as the Committee shall approve.

         (e)  Requirements  for  Transfer.  No share of Capital  Stock  shall be
issued or transferred under the Plan until all legal requirements  applicable to
the  issuance  or  transfer  of  such  shares  have  been  complied  with to the
satisfaction  of the Committee.  The Committee shall have the right to condition
any  issuance  of shares of  Capital  Stock  made to any  participant  upon such
participant's  written  undertaking  to  comply  with such  restrictions  on his
subsequent  disposition  of such shares as the  Committee or PepsiCo  shall deem
necessary or advisable as a result of any applicable law, regulation or official
interpretation  thereof,  and  certificates  representing  such  shares  may  be
legended to reflect any such restrictions.

         (f) Withholding Taxes.  PepsiCo shall have the right to deduct from all
awards  hereunder  paid in cash  any  federal,  state,  local or  foreign  taxes
required by law to be withheld  with respect to such awards and, with respect to
awards paid in stock or upon exercise of stock  options,  to require the payment
(through  withholding  from the  participant's  salary or otherwise) of any such
taxes.  The obligations of PepsiCo to make delivery of awards in cash or Capital
Stock  shall be  subject  to  currency  or  other  restrictions  imposed  by any
government.

         (g) No Rights to Awards.  Except as set forth  herein,  no  employee or
other  person  shall have any claim or right to be  granted  an award  under the
Plan.  Neither the Plan nor any action  taken  hereunder  shall be  construed as
giving any  employee any right to be retained in the employ of PepsiCo or any of
its subsidiaries, divisions or affiliates.
<PAGE>
         (h) Costs and Expenses. The cost and expenses of administering the Plan
shall be borne by  PepsiCo  and not  charged  to any award  nor to any  employee
receiving an award.

         (i) Funding of Plan.  The Plan shall be unfunded.  PepsiCo shall not be
required  to  establish  any  special  or  separate  fund or to make  any  other
segregation of assets to assure the payment of any award under the Plan.

10.      Effective Date, Amendments and Termination.

         (a)  Effective  Date.  The Plan shall  become  effective  on the date
it is approved by PepsiCo's shareholders.

         (b) Amendments. The Committee may at any time terminate or from time to
time  amend the Plan in whole or in part,  but no such  action  shall  adversely
affect any rights or  obligations  with respect to any awards  theretofore  made
under the Plan.

         Unless the  shareholders of PepsiCo shall have first approved  thereof,
no  amendment of the Plan shall be  effective  which would  increase the maximum
number of shares of PepsiCo  Capital Stock which may be delivered under the Plan
or to any one  individual,  except to the extent such amendment is made pursuant
to Section 7 hereof,  extend  the  maximum  period  during  which  awards may be
granted  under  the  Plan,   change  the  performance  goal  pursuant  to  which
performance  units are earned,  or modify the requirements as to eligibility for
participation in the Plan.

         With the consent of the  employee  affected,  the  Committee  may amend
outstanding  agreements  evidencing  awards  under  the  Plan  in a  manner  not
inconsistent with the terms of the Plan.

         (c)  Termination.  No  awards  of  stock  options,  performance  units,
incentive  stock  options or stock  appreciation  rights shall be made under the
Plan after December 31, 2004. No awards of restricted  stock shall be made under
the Plan after May 1, 1999.
