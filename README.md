[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This LLM application uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities of [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index) to generate insights about Apple and Pepsico's SEC 10-K documents.

The SEC 10-K documents are in the form of text files generated by SEC-EDGAR-Downloader module in Python. The data was taken from 1995 to 2023, generating 29 text files per ticker. 

## Inferences generated

- Yearly revenue and profit growth CAGR since 1995
- Gross profit margin since 1995
- Expenses growth vs profit growth since 1995
- Distribution and marketing cost vs revenue generated since 1995
- Average adjusted earnings per share
- CAGR for shareholders equity
- Growth of adjusted book value
- Assets/Liabilities ratio since 1995
