<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PepsiCo,  Inc.  was  incorporated  in Delaware in 1919 and was  reincorporated  in North  Carolina in 1986.  When used in this
Report the terms "we", "us", "our" and the "Company" means PepsiCo and its
divisions and subsidiaries.</font></p>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On August 2, 2001,  we  completed a merger  transaction  with The Quaker  Oats  Company  ("Quaker")  whereby  Quaker  became a
wholly-owned  subsidiary of PepsiCo.  Under the merger  agreement dated December 2, 2000,  Quaker  shareholders  received 2.3 shares of
PepsiCo  common stock in exchange for each share of Quaker  common stock,  including a cash payment for  fractional  shares.  We issued
approximately 306 million shares of our common stock in exchange for all the
outstanding common stock of Quaker.</font></p>

SNACKS</FONT></H2>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our snack food business is comprised of two business units: Frito-Lay North
America and Frito-Lay International.</font></p>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>
Frito-Lay North America</b></font></p>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Frito-Lay North America ("FLNA")  manufactures,  markets,  sells and distributes a varied line of salty, sweet and grain-based
snack foods  throughout  the United States and Canada,  including  Lay's potato chips,  Doritos and Tostitos  tortilla  chips,  Cheetos
cheese flavored  snacks,  Ruffles potato chips,  Fritos corn chips, a variety of dips and salsas,  Quaker Chewy granola bars, Rold Gold
pretzels,  Sunchips  multigrain  snacks,  WOW! brand low fat and no fat versions of potato and tortilla  chips,  Funyons onion flavored

         FLNA's products are transported from  manufacturing  plants to our major  distribution  centers,  principally by company-owned
trucks.  FLNA  primarily  utilizes  a direct  store  delivery  system,  whereby  its sales  force  delivers  the snacks  directly  from
distribution  centers to the store shelf.  This system  permits FLNA to work closely with retail trade  locations  and to be responsive
to their needs.  Frito-Lay believes this form of distribution  allows it to have a marketing  advantage and is essential for the proper
distribution of fragile products and products with a short shelf
life.</font></p>

         All of our businesses are highly competitive.  Our foods and beverages compete in the United States and  internationally  with
widely  distributed  products of a number of major  companies that operate in many of the areas we serve.  We also compete with private
label foods and beverages and with the products of local and regional  manufacturers.  The main areas of competition are price, quality

distribution.</font></p>

flavorings,  flour, juice concentrates,  oats, oranges, grapefruits and other fruits, potatoes, rice, seasonings,  sugar, vegetable and
essential  oils,  wheat,  and  packaging  materials.  Key  packaging  materials  include  P.E.T.  resin used for  plastic  bottles  and
cardboard.  Since we rely on trucks to move and distribute many of our products,  fuel is also an important  commodity.  These products
are  purchased  mainly in the open  market.  We employ  specialists  to secure  adequate  supplies  of many of these items and have not
experienced any significant  continuous  shortages.  Prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation.  When prices increase, we
may or may not pass on such  increases to our  customers.  When we have decided to pass along price  increases in the past we have done
so successfully.  However, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so
in the future.</font></p>

On August 2, 2001,  we completed a merger  transaction,  which  resulted in The Quaker Oats Company  (Quaker)  becoming a  wholly-owned

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><i>Principles  of  consolidation</i>  - The  financial  statements  include the  consolidated  accounts of PepsiCo,  Inc.  and its  controlled
affiliates.  Investments in unconsolidated  affiliates over which we exercise  significant  influence,  but not control,  are accounted
for by the equity  method.  Our  definition  of control for majority  owned  affiliates  considers the  exercisability  of the minority
interest  rights,  and  consolidation  would be precluded  to the extent that the minority  interest  holds  substantive  participating
rights.  Our share of the net income or loss of  unconsolidated  affiliates  accounted  for by the  equity  method is  included  in our
consolidated  net income.  As a result of changes in the  operations of our European  snack joint  venture,  we have  determined  that,
effective in 2002, consolidation is required.</font></p>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><i>Revenue  recognition</i>  - We  recognize  revenue when  products are  delivered  to  customers  consistent  with sales terms.  Sales terms
generally do not allow a right of return.</font></p>

<p align=center><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>10</font></p>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><i>Derivative  instruments and hedging</i> - We manage risks associated with commodity prices,  foreign exchange rates, interest rates and our
stock price and may use  derivative  instruments  to hedge these risks.  As a matter of policy,  we do not use  derivative  instruments
unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore,  we do not use derivative  instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  The
evaluation  of hedge  effectiveness  is  subject  to  assumptions  based on the  terms  and  timing of the  underlying  exposures.  All
derivative  instruments are recognized in our Consolidated  Balance Sheet at fair value.  The fair value of our derivative  instruments
is generally based on quoted market prices.</font></p>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><i>Asset  impairment</i> - All long-lived  assets,  including  goodwill,  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  and other  identifiable
intangibles,  are  evaluated  for  impairment  on the basis of  undiscounted  cash flows  whenever  events or changes in  circumstances
indicate that the carrying  amount of an asset may not be  recoverable.  An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market
value based on the best  information  available.  Estimated  fair market value is generally  measured by discounting  estimated  future
cash flows.  Considerable  management  judgment is necessary to estimate  discounted future cash flows.  Assumptions used in these cash
flows are consistent with internal forecasts.</font></p>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><i>Income  taxes</i> - Our  effective  tax rate and the tax bases of our assets and  liabilities  reflect our best  estimate  of the  ultimate
outcome of tax audits.  Valuation  allowances are established  where expected future taxable income does not support the realization of
the deferred tax assets.</font></p>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><i>Commitments  and  contingencies</i>  - We are subject to various  claims and  contingencies  related to lawsuits,  taxes and  environmental
matters,  as well as commitments under  contractual and other commercial  obligations.  We recognize  liabilities for contingencies and
commitments  when a loss is  probable  and  estimable.  Our  contractual  and  other  commercial  obligations  primarily  relate to the
procurement of goods and services in the normal course of business and to
guarantees related to our equity investees.</font></p>

<a name="ac"></a><p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><b>Transactions with Related and Other Parties</b></font></p>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Significant  related  parties  include our bottling  franchisees in which we own an equity  interest.  We have entered into  agreements
with  these  bottlers  and  expect  these  arrangements  to  continue.  These  agreements  cover the  prices  and terms for the sale of
concentrate  and full goods  bearing our  trademarks,  as well as the  manufacturing  and  distribution  of our fountain  products.  In
addition,  we provide various forms of marketing  support to or on behalf of our bottlers  covering a variety of initiatives  including
marketplace support,  marketing programs,  capital equipment and shared media expense. The level of this support is negotiated annually
and can be increased or decreased at our  discretion.  We provide this support  because we share a common  business  objective with our
bottlers of increasing the availability  and consumption of Pepsi-Cola  beverages and the level of support has a direct impact on these
objectives.  See  <a href=#ai>Liquidity  and Capital  Resources</a>  for related  party  commitments  and  guarantees
and <a href=#aj>Note 10</a> to our  consolidated
financial statements for additional information on related parties.</font></p>

<p align=center><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>11</font></p>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Certain  members of our Board of Directors  also serve on the boards of certain  vendors and  customers.  Our  transactions  with these
vendors and customers are in the normal  course of business and  consistent  with terms  negotiated  with other vendors and  customers.
Those Board members do not  participate  in vendor  selection  and  negotiations  nor in customer  negotiations.  In addition,  certain
officers  serve on the boards of our anchor  bottlers  and other  equity  investees  and may receive  compensation  from such  entities
consistent with that of other members serving on those boards.</font></p>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Comparisons  of 2000 to 2001 and 1999 are affected by an  additional  week of results in the 2000  reporting  year.  Because our fiscal
year ends on the last Saturday in December,  a fifty-third  week is added every five or six years.  The fifty-third week increased 2000
net sales by an estimated  $294  million,  operating  profit by an estimated  $62 million and net income by an estimated $44 million or
$0.02 per share.</font></p>

PepsiCo and The Quaker Oats Company</u></font></p>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Under the Quaker merger agreement dated December 2, 2000, Quaker  shareholders  received 2.3 shares of PepsiCo common stock in exchange
for each share of Quaker common stock,  including a cash payment for fractional  shares. We issued  approximately 306 million shares of
our common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of
Quaker.</font></p>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In connection with the merger  transaction,  we sold the global rights in our All Sport beverage brand to The Monarch Company,  Inc. of
Atlanta.  As part of the terms of the sale,  we agreed  that,  for 10 years after the Quaker  transaction  closing  date,  we would not
distribute  Gatorade  sports drink  through our bottling  system in the United States and would not include  Gatorade  with  Pepsi-Cola
products in certain marketing or promotional arrangements covering specific
distribution channels.</font></p>

<p align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The merger was  accounted for as a tax-free  transaction  and as a  pooling-of-interests.  As a result,  all prior period  consolidated
financial  statements  presented  have been restated to include the results of  operations,  financial  position and cash flows of both
companies  as if they had always been  combined.  Certain  reclassifications  were made to conform the  presentation  of the  financial

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Transaction costs were

investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, SEC filing fees, stock exchange
listing fees and financial printing and other related charges. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Integration costs represent
incremental one-time merger-related costs. Such costs include consulting fees
and expenses, expenses for accelerated vesting under change-in-control
provisions, information system integration costs and employee-related costs. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The restructuring charges
primarily reflect termination costs for approximately 580 corporate, sales,
distribution, manufacturing, research and marketing employees. Employee
termination costs include retirement benefit costs, severance costs and expenses
associated with change-in-control provisions of pre-merger employment contracts.
As of December 29, 2001, approximately 380 of the terminations have occurred.
The terminations are expected to be completed during 2002. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Additional merger-related

comparable real estate, less costs to sell, and the write off of the net book
value of equipment which could not be redeployed. The plant closures were

wholly-owned bottling businesses, referred to as The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG),
completed an initial public offering with PepsiCo retaining a direct
noncontrolling ownership interest of 35.5%. In May, we combined certain other
bottling operations with Whitman Corporation retaining a noncontrolling
ownership interest of approximately 38%. In July, we combined certain other
bottling operations with PepCom Industries, Inc. retaining a noncontrolling
interest of 35% in the combined entity renamed Pepsi Bottling Ventures, LLC. In
October, we formed a business venture with Pohlad Companies, a Pepsi-Cola
franchisee, retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 24%

<a name="ae"></a><p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><b>New Accounting
Standards</b></FONT></p>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On December 31, 2000, we
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. (SFAS) 133, <I>Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities</I>. SFAS 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging
activities. It requires that we recognize all derivative instruments as either
assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and measure those
instruments at fair value. The adoption of SFAS 133 on December 31, 2000
increased assets by approximately $12 million and liabilities by approximately
$10 million with approximately $3 million recognized in accumulated other
comprehensive income and a loss of less than $1 million recognized in the
Consolidated Statement of Income. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>During 2000 and 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board&#146;s (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) addressed various issues related to the income statement classification
of certain promotional payments, including consideration from a vendor to a
reseller or another party that purchases the vendor&#146;s products. EITF 01-9,
<I>Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of
the Vendor&#146;s Products</I> was issued in November 2001 and codified earlier
pronouncements. Primarily effective for 2002, adoption of EITF 01-9 will reduce
our net sales by $3.4 billion in 2001, $3.1 billion in 2000 and $2.9 billion in
1999, with selling, general and administrative expenses reduced by the same
amounts. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In July 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS 141, <I>Business Combinations.</I> SFAS 141 eliminates the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business combinations and modifies
the application of the purchase accounting method. The elimination of the
pooling-of-interests method is effective for transactions initiated after June
30, 2001. The remaining provisions of SFAS 141 are effective for transactions
accounted for using the purchase method that are completed after June 30, 2001.
Since our merger with Quaker (see <a href=#al>Note 2</a> to the consolidated financial
statements) was initiated in December 2000 and our acquisition of South Beach
Beverage Company, LLC (see <a href=#am>Note 4</a> to the consolidated financial statements) was
completed in January 2001, adoption of this statement does not have an impact on
our consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In July 2001, the FASB also
issued SFAS 142, <I>Goodwill and Intangibles.</I> SFAS 142 eliminates the
current requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,
addresses the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and addresses
impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets. SFAS 142
applies to existing goodwill and intangible assets, as well as to transactions
completed after the statement&#146;s effective date. SFAS 142 is effective for
2002. Adoption of SFAS 142 will increase income before taxes by approximately
$87 million in 2002 reflecting the cessation of goodwill amortization and
changes in the lives of other intangibles. The required transition impairment
evaluations are not expected to result in impairment charges. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In June 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS 143, <I>Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations</I>. SFAS 143
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs. It requires that we recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable
estimate of fair value can be made. We are currently assessing SFAS 143 and the
impact that adoption, in 2003, will have on our consolidated financial
statements. </FONT></P>

<p align=center><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>16</font></p>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In August 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS 144, <I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets</I>. SFAS 144 establishes a single model for the impairment of long-lived
assets and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more
disposal transactions. SFAS 144 is effective for 2002. Adoption will not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In the normal course of
business, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, including the
use of hedging transactions, executed in accordance with our policies. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Our hedging transactions
include, but are not limited to, the use of various derivative instruments. As a
matter of policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an
underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not use derivative instruments for
trading or speculative purposes. Any change in the value of our derivative
instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite change in the value of
the underlying hedged items. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Commodity
Prices</font></p>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We are subject to market
risk with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover
increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive
environment in which we operate. We manage this risk primarily through the use
of fixed-price purchase orders, pricing agreements, geographic diversity and
derivative instruments. Derivative instruments, including futures, options and
swaps, are used to hedge fluctuations in prices of a portion of anticipated
commodity purchases, primarily corn, oats, natural gas, heating oil, vegetable
oil and packaging materials. Our use of derivative instruments is not
significant to our commodity purchases. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Our commodity derivative
positions were $252 million at December 29, 2001 and $52 million at December 30,
2000. Our commodity derivative positions resulted in a net unrealized loss of
$16 million at December 29, 2001 and a net unrealized gain of $3 million at
December 30, 2000. We estimate that a 10% decline in commodity prices would have
increased the loss by $18 million in 2001 and reduced the gain by $6 million
resulting in a loss in 2000. </FONT></P>

Exchange</font></p>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>International operations
constitute about one-fifth of our annual business segment operating profit.
Operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in foreign
exchange rates, primarily the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar, euro
and Brazilian real, which principally impacts the translation of our
international operating profit into U.S. dollars. On occasion, we may enter into
derivative instruments, as necessary, to reduce the effect of foreign exchange
rate changes. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Our foreign currency
derivative positions had an aggregate notional value of $355 million, with $223
million relating to contracts to exchange British pounds for U.S. dollars, at
December 29, 2001 and $344 million, with $336 million relating to contracts to
exchange British pounds to U.S. dollars, at December 30, 2000. These forward
contracts had a net gain of $4 million at December 29, 2001 and losses of $9
million at December 30, 2000. We estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the
exchange rates would have decreased the 2001 gain by $35 million resulting in a
loss and increased the 2000 losses by $35 million. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Interest
Rates</font></p>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We centrally manage our
debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,
tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use interest rate and
currency swaps to effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific
debt issuances, with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs.
These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that
they are intended to modify. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity
date of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the
related debt. Our credit risk related to interest rate and currency swaps is
considered low because such swaps are entered into only with strong creditworthy
counterparties, are generally settled on a net basis and are of relatively short
duration. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Assuming year-end 2001 and
2000 variable rate debt and investment levels, a one-point increase in interest
rates would have increased net interest expense by $3 million in 2001 and $7
million in 2000. The change in this impact from 2000 resulted from decreased
variable debt levels and increased investment levels at year-end 2001. This
sensitivity analysis includes the impact of existing interest rate and currency
swaps. </FONT></P>

Price</font></p>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The portion of our deferred
compensation liability which is based on our stock price is subject to market
risk. Prepaid forward contracts with financial institutions with an aggregate
notional amount of $52 million at year-end 2001 were used to hedge this risk and
are accounted for as natural hedges. The change in fair value of these equity
derivative contracts resulted in $1 million of expense in 2001, $19 million of
income in 2000 and $6 million of expense in 1999. We estimate that a 10%
unfavorable change in the year-end stock price would have increased the 2001
loss by $6 million and reduced the 2000 gain by $7 million. </FONT></P>

euro currency conversion including, among others, adapting computer and

to accommodate euro-denominated transactions and took actions to reduce the
impact of one common currency on cross-border pricing. We have experienced no
business interruption as a result of the issuance and circulation of
euro-denominated bills and coins and the withdrawal of legacy currencies. The
system and equipment conversion costs were not material. Due to numerous
uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the long-term effects one common
currency may have on pricing and the resulting impact, if any, on financial

This increase was primarily driven by high single-digit growth in Mountain Dew

CASH FLOWS</b></FONT></p>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Operating cash flow for
2001 was $2.9 billion compared with $3.1 billion for 2000. Operating cash flow
primarily reflects externally reported net cash provided by operating activities
of $4.2 billion, excluding after-tax net interest payments and the cash payments
for merger-related costs and other impairment restructuring charges, less
capital spending, sales of property, plant and equipment and other net investing
activity. Our 2001 operating cash flow reflects a $421 million contribution to
our U.S. pension plans compared to a $70 million contribution in 2000. The 2001
payment was made following a review of our anticipated future sources and uses
of cash. We do not expect to make a cash contribution to our U.S. pension plans
in 2002. Additionally, in 2001, we received tax refunds of $62 million versus
$145 million in 2000. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>As shown in our
<a href=#b>Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows</a>, our 2001 cash and cash equivalents
decreased $355 million to $683 million reflecting cash used for investing and
financing activities primarily funded from net cash provided by operations. The
cash used in investing activities reflects capital spending, net purchases of
short-term investments, the acquisition of SoBe and the contribution to our
pension plans. The cash used in financing activities reflects share repurchases
and dividend payments, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock
options and the net proceeds of $524 million from the issuance of shares in
connection with the merger with Quaker. We issued 13.2 million shares of our
repurchased common stock to qualify for pooling-of-interests accounting
treatment. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Our 2000 cash and cash
equivalents decreased $208 million to $1 billion reflecting cash used for
financing and investing activities primarily funded from net cash provided by
operations. The cash used in financing activities reflects share repurchases,
dividend payments and net long-term debt payments, partially offset by proceeds
from the exercise of stock options. The cash used in investing activities
reflects capital spending and net purchases of short-term investments. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><u>Common Share Repurchases</u></font></p>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Quaker repurchased common shares totaling $242 million in 2000 and $373 million in 1999.</font></p>

<p align=center><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>31</font></p>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Subsequent to our merger
with Quaker, we repurchased 35 million shares of our common stock at a cost of
$1.7 billion under the emergency and exemptive orders from the Securities and
Exchange Commission aimed at facilitating the reopening of the U.S. equities
market on September 17, 2001, following the September 11th terrorist attacks.
Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion worth of
our common stock during the terms of the orders. Repurchases under the orders
did not compromise our ability to account for the merger with Quaker as a
pooling-of-interests. All authorizations for share repurchases have been
rescinded as a result of the PepsiCo and Quaker merger. </FONT></P>

<a name="ai"></a><p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><b>LIQUIDITY AND
CAPITAL RESOURCES</b></FONT></p>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Our strong cash-generating
capability and financial condition give us ready access to capital markets
throughout the world. Our principle source of liquidity is operating cash flows,
which are derived from net sales. Macroeconomic conditions may impact the demand
for and pricing of our products. Our debt rating of A1 from Moody&#146;s and A
from Standard &amp; Poor&#146;s contributes to our accessibility to global
capital markets. These ratings reflect our strong operating cash flows and
include the impact of the cash flows and debt of our anchor bottlers. We have
maintained these healthy ratings since 1989 demonstrating the stability of our
operating cash flows. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>At year-end 2001, we
maintained $750 million of revolving credit facilities. Of the $750 million,
approximately $375 million expires in June 2002 with the remaining $375 million
expiring in June 2006. Annually, these facilities are extendable for an
additional year upon the mutual consent of PepsiCo and the lending institutions.
The credit facilities exist largely to support issuances of short-term debt and
remain unused at year-end 2001. At year-end 2001, $375 million of short-term
borrowings were reclassified as long-term, reflecting our intent and ability,
through the existence of the unused credit facilities, to refinance these
borrowings on a long-term basis. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Quaker integration costs
will require cash, of which $228 million was paid in 2001. We expect the balance
will be paid in 2002 and 2003. </FONT></P>

<a name="ak"></a><H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Note 1 &#150; Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies</FONT></H2>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On August 2, 2001, we
completed our merger transaction, which resulted in The Quaker Oats Company
(Quaker) becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of PepsiCo. As a result, we restated
all prior period consolidated financial statements presented to reflect the
combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows of both
companies as if they had always been merged. See <A href=#al>Note 2</a>. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The preparation of the
consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Tabular dollars are in
millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per
share amounts, assume dilution unless noted, and are based on unrounded amounts.
Certain reclassifications were made to the 2000 and 1999 amounts to conform to
the 2001 presentation. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U>Items Affecting Comparability</U></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Our fiscal year ends on the
last Saturday in December and, as a result, a fifty-third week is added every
five or six years. The fiscal year ended December 30, 2000 consisted of
fifty-three weeks. The fifty-third week increased 2000 net sales by an estimated
$294 million, operating profit by an estimated $62 million and net income by an
estimated $44 million or $0.02 per share. See <A href=#ap>Note 21</a> for the impact on our
business segments. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The financial statements
include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and its controlled
affiliates. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates over which we exercise significant
influence, but not control, are accounted for by the equity method. Our
definition of control for majority owned affiliates considers the exercisability
of the minority interest rights, and consolidation would be precluded to the
extent that the minority interest holds substantive participating rights. Our
share of the net income or loss of unconsolidated affiliates accounted for by
the equity method is included in consolidated net income. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The issuance of stock by
one of our subsidiaries to third parties reduces our proportionate ownership
interest in the subsidiary. Unless the issuance of such stock is part of a
broader corporate reorganization, we recognize a gain or loss equal to the
difference between the issuance price per share and our carrying amount per
share. Such gain or loss, net of the related tax, is recognized in consolidated
net income when the transaction occurs. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We classify promotional
payments to customers, including cooperative advertising, as either a reduction
of net sales or as marketing costs. During 2000 and 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board&#146;s (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
addressed various issues related to the income statement classification of
certain promotional payments, including consideration from a vendor to a
reseller or another party that purchases the vendor&#146;s products. EITF 01-9,
<I>Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of
the Vendor&#146;s Products,</I> was issued in November 2001 and codified earlier
pronouncements. Primarily effective for 2002, adoption of EITF 01-9 will reduce
our net sales by $3.4 billion in 2001, $3.1 billion in 2000 and $2.9 billion in
1999, with selling, general and administrative expenses reduced by the same
amounts. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We measure stock-based
compensation cost as the excess of the quoted market price of PepsiCo common
stock at the grant date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock
(exercise price). Our policy is to generally grant stock options with an
exercise price equal to the stock price at the date of grant, and accordingly,
no compensation cost is recognized. Under certain prior incentive programs,
compensation cost for cash payments expected to be paid to employees in lieu of
stock options was based on the grant date value and recognized over the vesting
period of the award. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Our pension plans cover
substantially all full-time U.S. employees and certain international employees.
Benefits depend on years of service and earnings or are based on stated amounts
for each year of service. Our postretirement plans provide medical and life
insurance benefits principally to U.S. retirees and their dependents. Employees
are eligible for benefits if they meet age and service requirements and qualify
for retirement benefits. Plans generally use a measurement date of September 30.
The pre-merger Quaker plans used a measurement date of December 31. Prior
service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining
service period of employees expected to receive benefits. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U>Derivative Instruments and Hedging</U></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We manage risks associated
with commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates our stock price
and may use derivatives to hedge these risks. Hedging transactions are executed
in accordance with our policies. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivative
instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not use
derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Any change in the
value of our derivative instruments would be substantially offset by an opposite
change in the value of the underlying hedged items. All derivative instruments
are recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. The fair value
of our derivative instruments is generally based on quoted market prices. There
is no significant concentration of credit risk or activity with any of the
counterparties. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Using qualifying criteria
defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (SFAS) 133,
<I>Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,</I> derivative
instruments are designated and accounted for as either fair value or cash flow
hedges. Our evaluations of hedge effectiveness are subject to assumptions based
on the terms and timing of the underlying exposures. For a fair value hedge,
both the effective and ineffective portions of the change in fair value of the
derivative instrument, along with an adjustment to the carrying amount of the
hedged item for fair value changes attributable to the hedged risk, are
recognized in earnings. For a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of a
derivative instrument that is highly effective are deferred in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss until the underlying hedged item is recognized in
earnings. The ineffective portion is recognized in earnings immediately. If a
fair value or cash flow hedge was to cease to qualify for hedge accounting or be
terminated, it would continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value
until settled, but hedge accounting would be discontinued prospectively. If a
forecasted transaction were no longer probable of occurring, amounts previously
deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income would be recognized
immediately in earnings. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We are subject to market
risk with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover
increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive
environment in which we operate. We manage this risk primarily through the use
of fixed-price purchase orders, pricing agreements, geographic diversity and
derivative instruments. Derivative instruments, including futures, options and
swaps, are used to hedge fluctuations in prices of a portion of anticipated
commodity purchases, primarily corn, oats, natural gas, heating oil, vegetable
oil and packaging materials. Our use of derivative instruments is not
significant to our commodity purchases. Derivative instruments designated as
hedges of anticipated commodity purchases are accounted for generally as cash
flow hedges. The earnings impact from commodity hedges is classified as either
cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses consistent with
the expense classification of the underlying hedged items. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>F - 10</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>International operations
constitute about one-fifth of our annual business segment operating profit.
Operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in foreign
exchange rates, primarily the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar, euro
and Brazilian real, which principally impacts the translation of our
international operating profit into U.S. dollars. On occasion, we may enter into
derivative financial instruments, as necessary, to reduce the effect of foreign
exchange rate changes. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives
centrally. Derivative instruments designated as foreign exchange hedges are
generally accounted for as fair value hedges. The earnings impact from these
hedges is classified as either cost of sales or selling, general and
administrative expenses consistent with the expense classification of the
underlying hedged items. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We centrally manage our
debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks,
tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use interest rate and
currency swaps to effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific
debt issuances, with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs.
These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that
they are intended to modify. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity
date of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the
related debt. Our credit risk related to interest rate and currency swaps is
considered low because such swaps are entered into only with strong creditworthy
counterparties, are generally settled on a net basis and are of relatively short
duration. Interest rate and currency swaps are designated as hedges of
underlying fixed rate obligations and accounted for as fair value hedges. The
earnings impact from these hedges is classified as interest expense. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The portion of our deferred
compensation liability, which is based on our stock price, is subject to market
risk. Prepaid forward contracts with financial institutions are used to hedge
this risk and are accounted for as natural hedges. The earnings impact from
these hedges is classified as selling, general and administrative expenses
consistent with the expense classification of the deferred compensation
liability. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 133, the earnings impact from these
equity derivative contracts was classified as interest income. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The cash flows related to
the above derivative instruments are classified in the Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows in a manner consistent with those of the transactions being hedged. </FONT></P>

basis over their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 20 years. </FONT></P>


<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U>Asset Impairment</U></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>All long-lived assets,
including goodwill, investments in unconsolidated affiliates and other
identifiable intangibles, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of
undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impaired asset
is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information
available. Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting
estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to
estimate discounted future cash flows. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The depreciation or
amortization periods for long-lived assets to be held and used are periodically
evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred that

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U>Income Taxes</U></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Deferred taxes are recorded
to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax
assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit
in future years. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we
have taken a tax deduction, but have not yet recorded in the Consolidated
Statement of Income. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax
assets where the amount of expected future taxable income from operations does
not support the realization of these deferred tax assets. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Deferred tax liabilities

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U>Accounting Changes</U></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In July 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS 141, <I>Business Combinations. </I>SFAS 141 eliminates the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business combinations and modifies
the application of the purchase accounting method. The elimination of the
pooling-of-interests method is effective for transactions initiated after June
30, 2001. The remaining provisions of SFAS 141 are effective for transactions
accounted for using the purchase method that are completed after June 30, 2001.
Since our merger with Quaker (see <A href=#al>Note 2</a>) was initiated in December 2000 and our
acquisition of South Beach Beverage Company, LLC (see <A href=#am>Note 4</a>) was completed in
January 2001, adoption of this statement does not have an impact on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=center><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>F - 12</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In July 2001, the FASB also
issued SFAS 142, <I>Goodwill and Intangible Assets. </I>SFAS 142 eliminates the
current requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,
addresses the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and addresses
impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets. SFAS 142
applies to existing goodwill and intangible assets, as well as to transactions
completed after the statement&#146;s effective date. SFAS 142 is effective for
2002. Adoption of SFAS 142 will increase income before taxes by approximately
$87 million in 2002 reflecting the cessation of goodwill amortization and
changes in the lives of other intangibles. The required transition impairment
evaluations are not expected to result in impairment charges. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In June 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS 143, <I>Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations</I>. SFAS 143
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with
the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs. It requires that we recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable
estimate of fair value can be made. We are currently assessing SFAS 143 and the
impact that adoption, in 2003, will have on our consolidated financial
statements. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In August 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS 144, <I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets</I>. SFAS 144 establishes a single model for the impairment of long-lived
assets and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more
disposal transactions. SFAS 144 is effective for 2002. Adoption will not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The 2001 and 2000 other
impairment and restructuring charges relate to a three-year supply chain
reconfiguration project announced in 1999 to upgrade and optimize Quaker&#146;s
manufacturing and distribution capabilities across all of its North American
businesses. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The asset impairment
charges primarily reflect the reduction in the carrying value of the land,
buildings and production machinery and equipment to their estimated fair market
value based on analyses of the liquidation values of similar assets. The
restructuring charges primarily included severance and termination benefits for
approximately 1,000 employees and other shutdown costs. No future charges are
expected on this project. </FONT></P>

A charge of $65 million, for asset impairment of $37 million and
restructuring charges of $28 million, related to the closure of three plants and
impairment of equipment at Frito-Lay North America. The asset impairment charges
primarily reflected the reduction in the carrying value of the land and
buildings to their estimated fair market value based on selling prices for
comparable real estate, less costs to sell, and the write off of the net book
value of equipment which could not be redeployed. The plant closures were
completed during 1999. The majority of these assets were either disposed of or
abandoned in 1999. The restructuring charges of $28 million primarily included
severance costs and plant closing costs. </FONT><BR><BR></td></tr>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>During 1999, we completed a series of transactions creating our anchor bottlers that manufacture, sell and
distribute carbonated and non-carbonated Pepsi-Cola beverages under master bottling agreements with us. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In April 1999, certain wholly-owned bottling businesses, referred to as The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG),
completed an initial public offering with PepsiCo retaining a direct noncontrolling ownership interest of 35.5%. We received $5.5 billion of debt proceeds as settlement of pre-existing intercompany amounts due to us and recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.0 billion ($476 million after-tax or $0.26 per
share) as a result of the transaction. In May, we combined certain other bottling operations with Whitman Corporation to create new Whitman, retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 38%. The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss to PepsiCo of $206 million or $0.11 per share. In July, we
combined certain other bottling operations with PepCom Industries, Inc.  retaining a noncontrolling interest of 35% in the combined entity renamed Pepsi Bottling Ventures, LLC. This transaction was accounted for as a nonmonetary
exchange for book purposes. However, a portion of the transaction was taxable and resulted in income tax expense of $25 million or $0.01 per share. In October, we formed a business venture with Pohlad Companies, a Pepsi-Cola franchisee, retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest of approximately 24% in the venture&#146;s principal operating subsidiary, PepsiAmericas, Inc. The
transaction was structured as a fair value exchange with no resulting gain or loss. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In December 2000, Whitman merged with PepsiAmericas. At year-end 2001, we owned approximately 37% of the
combined company. As part of the merger, we participate in an earn-out option whereby we may receive additional shares when certain performance targets are
met. Effective January 2001, the name of the combined company was changed to PepsiAmericas. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><u>PBG</u></font></p>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In addition to approximately 38% of PBG&#146;s outstanding common stock that we own at year-end
2001, we own 100% of PBG&#146;s class B common stock and approximately 7% of the equity of Bottling Group, LLC, PBG&#146;s principal operating subsidiary. This
gives us economic ownership of approximately 42% of PBG&#146;s combined operations. </FONT></P>

Derivative and Financial Instruments</FONT></H2>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On December 31, 2000, we
adopted SFAS 133. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments and for hedging activities. It requires that we recognize
all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. The adoption of SFAS
133 on December 31, 2000 increased assets by approximately $12 million and
liabilities by approximately $10 million with approximately $3 million
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and a loss of less than $1
million recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Accumulated other
comprehensive loss included net accumulated derivative losses of $18 million as
of December 29, 2001. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><u>Cash Flow Hedges</u></font></p>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>During the next twelve
months, we expect to reclassify losses of approximately $1 million from
accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings. All cash flow hedges at
December 29, 2001 are for periods of less than two years. Ineffectiveness
resulting from cash flow hedging activities was not material to our results of
operations. No cash flow hedges were discontinued during the year ended December
29, 2001 as a result of anticipated transactions that are no longer probable of
occurring. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><u>Fair Value Hedges</u></font></p>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Ineffectiveness resulting
from fair value hedging activities was not material to our results of
operations. All components of each derivative&#146;s gain or loss are included
in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. In 2001, there were no hedged firm
commitments that no longer qualified as fair value hedges. See <A href=#aq>Note 12</a> for the
notional amounts, related interest rates and maturities of the interest rate and
currency swaps. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><u>Prepaid Forward Contracts</u></font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The change in the fair
value of these equity derivative contracts resulted in $1 million of expense
during 2001, $19 million of income during 2000 and $6 million of expense during
1999. These changes in fair value were substantially offset by opposite changes
in the amount of the underlying deferred compensation liability. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>All senior management and
certain middle management awards are made under the LTIP. Under the LTIP, awards
are generally based on a multiple of base salary. The options generally become
exercisable at the end of three years and have a 10-year term. In 2001, the
entire award was made in stock options with an exercise price equal to the
average stock price on the date of the award. From 1998 through 2000, two-thirds
of the award consisted of stock options with the balance paid in stock options
or cash. At the date of these awards, the employee selected whether the
remaining one-third of the award will be granted in stock options or paid in
cash at the end of three years. The number of options granted or the cash
payment, if any, depended on the attainment of prescribed performance goals over
the three-year measurement period. If stock options were selected, they will be
granted with an exercise price equal to the average stock price on the date of
the grant, will vest immediately and have a 10-year term. If a cash payment is
selected, one dollar of cash will be received for every four dollars of the
award. Amounts expensed for expected cash payments were $64.0 million in 2001,
$36.7 million in 2000 and $17.9 million in 1999. At year-end 2001, 57 million
shares were available for grants under the LTIP. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Quaker established an ESOP
for the benefit of its employees to issue debt and to use the proceeds of such
debt to acquire shares of stock for future allocation to ESOP participants. The
final ESOP award was made in June 2001. The ESOP borrowings are included in
long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As annual contributions were
made to the ESOP, these contributions, along with the dividends accumulated on
the common and preferred stock held by the ESOP, were used to repay the
outstanding loans. As the loans were repaid, common and preferred stock were
allocated to ESOP participants and deferred compensation was reduced by the
amount of the principal payments on the loans. </FONT></P>

Note 21 - Business Segments</FONT></H2>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In early 1999, in
contemplation of the separation from PepsiCo of our bottling operations, we
completed a reorganization of our beverage businesses and presented our
operating results for 1999 consistent with the new beverage organization.
Therefore, the results of previously consolidated bottling operations in which
we now own an equity interest through the applicable transaction closing dates
in 1999 are presented separately with the first quarter 1999 equity income or
loss of other unconsolidated bottling affiliates. From the applicable
transaction closing dates in 1999, the equity income of those previously
consolidated bottling operations and the equity income or loss of other
unconsolidated bottling affiliates from the second quarter of 1999 are presented
separately below operating profit in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The
combined results of our six ongoing reportable segments are referred to as New
PepsiCo. The North American segments include the United States and Canada. </FONT></P>

Responsibility for Financial Statements</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>To Our
Shareholders:</font></p>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Management is responsible
for the reliability of the consolidated financial statements and related notes.
The financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles and include amounts based upon our estimates and
assumptions, as required. The financial statements have been audited by our
independent auditors, KPMG LLP, who were given free access to all financial
records and related data, including minutes of the meetings of the Board of
Directors and Committees of the Board. We believe that our representations to
the independent auditors are valid and appropriate. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Management maintains a
system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the
reliability of the financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from
unauthorized use or disposition. The system is supported by formal policies and
procedures, including an active Code of Conduct program intended to ensure
employees adhere to the highest standards of personal and professional
integrity. Our internal audit function monitors and reports on the adequacy of
and compliance with the internal control system, and appropriate actions are
taken to address significant control deficiencies and other opportunities for
improving the system as they are identified. The Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors consists solely of directors who are not salaried employees and who
are, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, free from any relationship that
would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment as a committee member.
The Committee meets during the year with representatives of management,
including internal auditors and the independent accountants to review our
financial reporting process and our controls to safeguard assets. Both our
independent auditors and internal auditors have free access to the Audit
Committee. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Although no cost-effective
internal control system will preclude all errors and irregularities, we believe
our controls as of December 29, 2001 provide reasonable assurance that the
financial statements are reliable and that our assets are reasonably
safeguarded. </FONT></P>

of Income, Cash Flows and Common Shareholders&#146; Equity for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 29, 2001. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of PepsiCo, Inc.&#145;s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We conducted our audits in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries as

The  Executive  acknowledges  and agrees  that:  (i) the  purpose of the

foregoing  covenants,  including without  limitation the  noncompetition  covenant of Section 6(c),  is to protect the goodwill,  trade
secrets and other  Confidential  Information  of the Company;  (ii) because  of the nature of the business in which the Company and the
Affiliated  Companies are engaged and because of the nature of the  Confidential  Information  to which the  Executive  has access,  it
would be impractical  and  excessively  difficult to determine the actual  damages of the Company and the  Affiliated  Companies in the
event the Executive  breached any of the covenants of this  Section 6;  and  (iii) remedies  at law (such as monetary  damages) for any
breach of the Executive's  obligations  under this Section 6 would be inadequate.  The Executive  therefore agrees and consents that if
he commits any breach of a covenant under this  Section 6 or threatens to commit any such breach,  the Company shall have the right (in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or remedy that may be available to it) to temporary  and permanent  injunctive  relief
from a court of  competent  jurisdiction,  without  posting any bond or other  security  and without the  necessity  of proof of actual
damage.  With respect to any provision of this Section 6 finally  determined by a court of competent  jurisdiction to be unenforceable,
the Executive and the Company hereby agree that such court shall have  jurisdiction  to reform this  Agreement or any provision  hereof
so that it is  enforceable  to the maximum extent  permitted by law, and the parties agree to abide by such court's  determination.  If
any of the covenants of this Section 6 are determined to be wholly or partially  unenforceable in any jurisdiction,  such determination
shall not be a bar to or in any way diminish the Company's right to enforce any such covenant in any other jurisdiction.</font><br><Br></td></tr></table>

arbitration in the City of Chicago in accordance with the laws of the State of

one by the Executive, and the third shall be appointed by the first two
arbitrators. If the first two arbitrators cannot agree on the appointment of a
third arbitrator, then the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the Chief
Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The
arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American
Arbitration Association, except with respect to the selection of arbitrators
which shall be as provided in this Section 10. Judgment upon the award rendered
by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. In
the event that it shall be necessary or desirable for the Executive to retain
legal counsel or incur other costs and expenses in connection with enforcement
of his rights under this Agreement, Executive shall be entitled to recover from
the Parent his reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and costs and expenses in
connection with enforcement of his rights (including the enforcement of any
arbitration award in court). Payment shall be made to the Executive by the
Parent at the time these attorneys&#146; fees and costs and expenses are
incurred by the Executive. If, however, the arbitrators should later determine
that under the circumstances the Executive could have had no reasonable
expectation of prevailing on the merits at the time he initiated the arbitration
based on the information then available to him, he shall repay any such payments
to the Parent in accordance with the order of the arbitrators. Any award of the
arbitrators shall include interest at a rate or rates considered just under the
circumstances by the arbitrators. </FONT></P>

Agreement between the Company and the Executive dated April 3, 2000 (the

matters consistent therewith. The agreement of Executive set forth in the
preceding sentence shall be effective as of the date of execution of this
Agreement, notwithstanding the Effective Date provisions of Section 1(a) or the

matter hereof and shall supersede all prior agreements with respect thereto,
including, without limitation, the 1997 Employment Agreement and the ESA. In the

                                              TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ROBERT S. MORRISON</b></font></p>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U>Employment Period</U>:
Eighteen (18) months following the Effective Date (the &#147;Initial
Term&#148;). The term shall automatically be extended at the end of the Initial
Term for one additional year (any such additional period being the
&#147;Extended Term&#148;), and for one additional year at the end of each
Extended Term, unless the Executive or Parent shall give written notice of
non-renewal to the other party at least one year prior to the scheduled end of
the Initial Term or such Extended Term. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U>Position</u>:  Vice Chairman of Parent and Chairman and CEO of the Company; Director of Parent and Company.
</font></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U>Minimum Annual Rate of
Base Salary</U>: $1,107,750; provided, such amount of Executive&#146;s Base
Salary as exceeds the maximum amount allowable as a deduction by the Company (or
Parent as the case may be) under Section 162(m) of the Code shall be deferred
and payable to the Executive in the first succeeding year in which such amount
shall be so allowable, but not later than the date on which Executive terminates
employment with the Company, unless such amounts have been deferred at the
election of Executive under the Parent&#146;s Executive Income Deferral Program,
in which case such amount shall be paid in accordance with the terms thereof). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U>Annual Bonus</U>: The
Executive shall be eligible to receive an annual bonus with respect to the
calendar year in which the Effective Date occurs based on the Company&#146;s
performance as measured against goals related to general Company performance and
to the assimilation of the Company into Parent, which goals shall be established
in consultation with Executive. The target annual bonus for such period shall
not be less than 100% of the Base Salary payable for such calender year (which
Base Salary shall be determined by including any amount deferred for such year
pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code), with a maximum bonus opportunity of not
less than 200% of such Base Salary. To the extent that the Executive receives a
pro rata bonus award under the Company&#146;s bonus plan as in effect prior to
the Effective Date for the period from January 1, 2001 through the Effective
Date, then the Annual Bonus payable with respect to the remainder of such
calendar year shall be a pro rata bonus, based on the fraction of the calendar
remaining as of the Effective Date. With respect to each subsequent calendar
year in the Employment Term, the Executive shall be eligible to receive an
annual bonus with respect to the calendar year based on the Company&#146;s
performance as measured against goals established in consultation with
Executive, and based on an annual target bonus of 100% of Base Salary and a
maximum bonus opportunity of 200% of Base Salary. To the extent that
Executive&#146;s employment during such calendar year is less than the full
calendar year (for example, because the Initial Term expires during such year
and is not renewed), then such annual bonus shall be pro rated to reflect such
period. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U>Supplemental
Payment</U>: Executive shall receive a Supplemental Payment equal to $19.2
million (the &#147;Supplemental Payment&#148;); provided, however, that Parent,
Company and Executive acknowledge that such amount is based on a December 1,
2000, estimate prepared by Arthur Andersen LLP (which estimate has been
delivered to Parent, Company and Executive and assumes certain facts not known
as the date hereof) and Arthur Andersen LLP shall update the calculation of the
Supplemental Payment immediately prior to the Effective Date based upon the
actual facts, which updated amount shall be the Supplemental Payment. Unless the
Supplemental Payment is to be credited to the Parent&#146;s Executive Income
Deferral Program pursuant to the election of the Executive made in the time and
manner required by such Plan (in which case it shall be paid in accordance with
the terms thereof), the Supplemental Payment shall be paid not later than thirty
(30) days following the last day the Initial Term, provided Executive is
employed with the Company or an Affiliated Company through such date. The
Executive&#146;s death, termination by the Executive for Good Reason or
termination of Executive by the Parent or Company other than for Cause shall be
a &#147;Qualifying Termination.&#148; Upon a Qualifying Termination before the
Supplemental Payment has been paid in full, the Executive (or his beneficiary)
shall be entitled to receive such unpaid Supplemental Payment in a lump sum no
later than thirty (30) days following such termination, unless the Supplemental
Payment is to be credited to the Parent&#146;s Executive Income Deferral Program
pursuant to the election of the Executive made in the time and manner required
by such Plan (in which case it shall be paid in accordance with the terms
thereof). In the event the Executive&#146;s employment terminates prior to the
last day of the Initial Term for any reason other than a Qualifying Termination,
Executive shall forfeit his right to receive the Supplemental Payment. </FONT></P>

                                              OPTIONS TO BE GRANTED TO ROBERT S. MORRISON</b></font></p>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U>Number of Options</U>:
In each of 2001 and 2002, Executive will be granted a 10-year option with
respect to no less than 300,000 shares of Parent common stock. The 2001 grant
shall be made not later than 30 days after the Effective Date and the 2002 grant
will be made in 2002 when options are granted to Parent officers generally, but
no later than the first anniversary of the Effective Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U>Per-share exercise
price</U>: The options will be priced at the &#147;Fair Market Value,&#148; as
defined in the LTIP, of the Parent stock on the Effective Date and will vest and
become exercisable as to all of the shares on the third anniversary of the date
of grant (or such earlier date as may be provided under the LTIP, such as upon
death or the occurrence of a change in control). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><U>General Terms and
Conditions</U>: The options otherwise will be subject to the LTIP. A Qualifying
Termination (as defined in Exhibit A) prior to the end of the Initial Term, and
any termination upon or after the last day of the Initial Term, will cause such
options to vest in full and to remain outstanding and become exercisable on the
third anniversary of the date of grant (or such earlier date as any be provided
under the LTIP, such as upon death or the occurrence of a change in control) as
if Executive&#146;s employment had not terminated, and such options shall not
expire before the last day of the 10-year grant. In the event the
Executive&#146;s employment terminates prior to the last day of the Initial Term
for any reason other than a Qualifying Termination, any option granted pursuant
to this Exhibit B shall be forfeited. </FONT></P>
