                                     PART I
ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

      PepsiCo, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware in 1919 and was
reincorporated   in  North  Carolina  in  1986.  Unless  the  context  indicates
otherwise,  when used in this Report the term  "PepsiCo"  shall mean the Company
and its divisions and subsidiaries. PepsiCo is engaged in the beverage and snack
food  businesses.  On October  6,  1997,  the  Company  spun off  certain of its
restaurant  businesses,   consisting  of  Pizza  Hut,  Taco  Bell  and  KFC,  to
shareholders as an independent publicly-traded company. In addition, in 1997 the
Company disposed of PFS, its restaurant  distribution operation and its non-core
restaurant businesses.

BEVERAGES

     PepsiCo's beverage  businesses,  which operate as Pepsi-Cola  Company,  are
comprised  of  two  business  units:  Pepsi-Cola  North  America  ("PCNA"),  and
Pepsi-Cola Company International ("PCI").

      PCNA manufactures and sells beverage  products,  primarily soft drinks and
soft  drink  concentrates,  in the  United  States  and  Canada.  PCNA sells its
concentrates to licensed bottlers  ("Pepsi-Cola  bottlers").  Under appointments
from PepsiCo,  Pepsi-Cola  bottlers  manufacture,  sell and  distribute,  within
defined territories, soft drinks and syrups bearing trademarks owned by PepsiCo,
including  PEPSI-COLA,  DIET PEPSI,  MOUNTAIN  DEW,  SLICE,  MUG, ALL SPORT and,
within  Canada,  7UP and DIET 7UP (these  products are sometimes  referred to as
"Pepsi-Cola  beverages").  The Pepsi/Lipton Tea Partnership,  a joint venture of
PCNA and Lipton,  develops and sells tea concentrate to Pepsi-Cola  bottlers and
develops and markets  ready-to-drink  tea products  under the LIPTON  trademark.
Such products are  distributed  by  Pepsi-Cola  bottlers  throughout  the United
States and Canada.

      Pepsi-Cola  beverages are manufactured in approximately 165 plants located
throughout the United States and Canada. PCNA operates  approximately 60 plants,
and manufactures,  sells and distributes beverages throughout  approximately 450
licensed  territories,  accounting  for  approximately  60%  of  the  Pepsi-Cola
beverages  sold in the United  States and Canada.  Approximately  105 plants are
operated  by  independent   licensees  or   unconsolidated   affiliates,   which
manufacture,  sell and distribute  approximately 40% of the Pepsi-Cola beverages
sold in the United States and Canada. PCNA has a minority interest in 8 of these
licensees, comprising approximately 70 licensed territories.

      PCI  manufactures and sells beverage  products,  primarily soft drinks and
soft drink  concentrates,  outside the United  States and Canada.  PCI sells its
concentrates to Pepsi-Cola bottlers. Under appointments from PepsiCo, Pepsi-Cola
bottlers manufacture, sell and distribute, within defined territories, beverages
bearing PEPSI-COLA,  7UP, MIRINDA, DIET PEPSI, PEPSI MAX, MOUNTAIN DEW, DIET 7UP
and other trademarks. PCI operates 37 plants bottling PepsiCo beverage products.
There  are  approximately  275  plants  operated  by  independent  licensees  or
unconsolidated   affiliates  bottling  PepsiCo's  beverage  products  which  are
available in 186 countries and territories outside the United States and Canada.
Principal international markets include Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Mexico,
the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom.

                                       2
<PAGE>

      PCNA and PCI make  programs  available  to  assist  licensed  bottlers  in
servicing  markets,  expanding  operations and improving  production methods and
facilities.  PCNA and PCI also offer  assistance to  Pepsi-Cola  bottlers in the
distribution, advertising and marketing of PepsiCo's beverage products and offer
sales assistance through special  merchandising and promotional  programs and by
training bottler  personnel.  PCNA and PCI maintain control over the composition
and quality of beverages sold under PepsiCo trademarks.

SNACK FOODS

      PepsiCo's snack food businesses,  which operate as The Frito-Lay  Company,
are   comprised  of  Frito-Lay   North  America   ("Frito-Lay")   and  Frito-Lay
International ("FLI").

      Frito-Lay  manufactures  and  sells a  varied  line of salty  snack  foods
throughout  the United  States and Canada,  including  LAY'S and  RUFFLES  brand
potato  chips,  DORITOS and TOSTITOS  brand  tortilla  chips,  FRITOS brand corn
chips,  CHEEoTOS  brand cheese  flavored  snacks,  ROLD GOLD brand  pretzels and
SUNCHIPS brand multigrain snacks.

      Frito-Lay's  products are  transported  from its  manufacturing  plants to
major  distribution  centers,  principally by  company-owned  trucks.  Frito-Lay
utilizes a "store-door-delivery" system, whereby its approximately 20,000 person
sales force delivers the snacks directly to the store shelf. This system permits
Frito-Lay to work  closely with  approximately  500,000  retail trade  customers
weekly and to be  responsive  to their needs.  Frito-Lay  believes  this form of
distribution  is a  valuable  marketing  tool and is  essential  for the  proper
distribution of products with a short shelf life.

      FLI's  products are available in 111  countries  outside the United States
and Canada through company-owned  facilities and unconsolidated  affiliates.  On
most of the European continent,  PepsiCo's snack food business consists of Snack
Ventures  Europe,  a joint venture between  PepsiCo and General Mills,  Inc., in
which  PepsiCo  owns a 60%  interest.  FLI also  sells a variety  of snack  food
products  which appeal to local tastes  including,  for example,  WALKERS  brand
snack  foods,  sold in the United  Kingdom,  WEDEL brand sweet  snacks,  sold in
Poland,  and GAMESA brand cookies and ALEGRO brand sweet snacks,  which are sold
in Mexico. In addition, RUFFLES, LAY'S, CHEEoTOS, DORITOS, FRITOS, TOSTITOS, and
SUNCHIPS brand salty snack foods have been introduced to international  markets.
Principal  international  markets include Brazil,  France,  Mexico,  Poland, the
Netherlands, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom.

COMPETITION

      Both of PepsiCo's  businesses are highly competitive.  PepsiCo's beverages
and snack foods  compete in the United  States and  internationally  with widely
distributed  products of a number of major companies that have plants in many of
the areas  PepsiCo  serves,  as well as with private label soft drinks and snack
foods and with the products of local and regional  manufacturers.  For PepsiCo's
industry segments,  the main areas of competition are price, quality and variety
of products, and customer service.

EMPLOYEES

      At December 27, 1997,  PepsiCo employed,  subject to seasonal  variations,
approximately   142,000  persons  (including   approximately   12,000  part-time
employees),   of  whom  approximately  79,000  (including  approximately  10,000
part-time  employees) were employed within the United States.  PepsiCo  believes
that its relations with employees are generally good.

RAW MATERIALS AND OTHER SUPPLIES

      The  principal  materials  used by PepsiCo in its  beverage and snack food
businesses are corn  sweeteners,  sugar,  aspartame,  flavorings,  vegetable and
essential oils, potatoes, corn, flour, seasonings and packaging materials. Since
PepsiCo  relies on trucks to move and distribute  many of its products,  fuel is
also an important  commodity.  PepsiCo  employs  specialists to secure  adequate
supplies  of many  of  these  items  and has  not  experienced  any  significant
continuous  shortages.  Prices  paid by PepsiCo  for such  items are  subject to
fluctuation. When prices increase, PepsiCo may or may not pass on such increases
to its  customers.  Generally,  when  PepsiCo  has  decided to pass along  price
increases, it has done so successfully.  There is no assurance that PepsiCo will
be able to do so in the future.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS

      The conduct of PepsiCo's businesses, and the production,  distribution and
use of many of its products,  are subject to various  federal laws,  such as the
Food,  Drug and  Cosmetic  Act, the  Occupational  Safety and Health Act and the
Americans  with  Disabilities  Act. The conduct of PepsiCo's  businesses is also
subject to state, local and foreign laws.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND FRANCHISES

      PepsiCo owns numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to PepsiCo's
worldwide  businesses,  including  PEPSI-COLA,  PEPSI,  DIET  PEPSI,  PEPSI MAX,
MOUNTAIN  DEW,  SLICE,  MUG,  ALL SPORT,  7UP and DIET 7UP  (outside  the United
States),  MIRINDA,   FRITO-LAY,   LAY'S,  DORITOS,  RUFFLES,  TOSTITOS,  FRITOS,
CHEEoTOS, CRACKER JACK, ROLD GOLD, SUNCHIPS, SANTITAS,  SMARTFOOD,  SABRITAS and
WALKERS.  Trademarks  remain  valid  so long  as  they  are  used  properly  for
identification  purposes,  and PepsiCo emphasizes correct use of its trademarks.
PepsiCo has authorized (through licensing or franchise  arrangements) the use of
many of its trademarks in such contexts as Pepsi-Cola bottling  appointments and
snack  food  joint  ventures.  In  addition,  PepsiCo  licenses  the  use of its
trademarks on  collateral  products for the primary  purpose of enhancing  brand
awareness.

     PepsiCo either owns or has licenses to use a number of patents which relate
to certain of its products and the  processes  for their  production  and to the
design and operation of various equipment used in its businesses.  Some of these
patents are licensed to others.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

      PepsiCo  continues to make  expenditures  in order to comply with federal,
state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations,  which expenditures
have not been  material  with respect to  PepsiCo's  capital  expenditures,  net
income or competitive position.

each of PepsiCo's industry segments and major geographic areas of operations, as
well  as  capital  spending,  acquisitions  and  investments  in  unconsolidated
affiliates,  amortization of intangible assets and depreciation expense for each
industry  segment  for 1997,  1996 and 1995 is  contained  in Item 8  "Financial

ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

BEVERAGES

which 93 are owned and 18 are  leased,  and  unconsolidated  affiliates  operate
approximately  74 plants.  In addition,  PepsiCo's  beverage  business  operates
approximately  365  warehouses  or offices in the United  States and Canada,  of
which approximately 250 are owned and approximately 115 are leased.

      PepsiCo owns a research and technical facility in Valhalla,  New York, for
its beverage businesses.  PepsiCo also owns the headquarters  facilities for its
beverage  businesses  in  Somers,  New York.  PepsiCo is seeking a buyer for the
Somers  facility,  and certain  departments of the beverage  businesses  will be
moving to Purchase, New York to share the corporate headquarters building.

SNACK FOODS

      Frito-Lay  operates 55 food  manufacturing  and  processing  plants in the
United States and Canada,  of which 49 are owned and 6 are leased.  In addition,
Frito-Lay owns 182 warehouses and distribution  centers and leases approximately
40  warehouses  and  distribution  centers for  storage of food  products in the
United States and Canada.  Approximately  1,675 smaller  warehouses  and storage
spaces  located  throughout  the  United  States and Canada are leased or owned.
Frito-Lay  owns its  headquarters  building  and a research  facility  in Plano,
Texas.  Frito-Lay  also  leases  offices  in  Dallas,  Texas and  leases or owns
sales/regional  offices  throughout  the  United  States.  PepsiCo's  snack food
businesses  also  operate   approximately  70  plants  and   approximately   930
distribution  centers,  warehouses and offices  outside of the United States and
Canada.

GENERAL

      The Company owns its  corporate  headquarters  buildings in Purchase,  New
York.

      With a few  exceptions,  leases of plants in the United  States and Canada
are on a long-term basis,  expiring at various times,  with options to renew for
additional periods. Most international plants are leased for varying and usually
shorter periods, with or without renewal options.

      PepsiCo  believes that its properties are in good operating  condition and
are suitable for the purposes for which they are being used.

ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      PepsiCo  is  subject  to  various  claims  and  contingencies  related  to
lawsuits,  taxes,  environmental  and other  matters  arising  out of the normal
course of business.  Management believes that the ultimate liability, if any, of
the claims and  contingencies  in excess of amounts already provided for, is not
likely  to have a  material  adverse  effect  on  PepsiCo's  annual  results  of
operations or financial condition.

INTRODUCTION

Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  is  presented  in  four  sections.  The
introductory  section discusses the 1997 Disposal of the Restaurants Segment and
two pervasive issues impacting many companies,  Market Risk and Year 2000 (pages
9-11).  The  second  section  analyzes  the  Results of  Operations,  first on a
consolidated basis and then for each of our two

                                       8
<PAGE>

industry segments (pages 11-23). The final two sections address our consolidated
Cash Flows and Liquidity and Capital Resources (pages 23-26).

Cautionary Statements
From time to time,  in written  reports  and oral  statements,  we  discuss  our
expectations  regarding  PepsiCo's future  performance.  These  "forward-looking
statements" are based on currently available competitive, financial and economic
data and our operating plans. They are also inherently uncertain,  and investors
must  recognize  that events could turn out to be  significantly  different from
what we expect.

Disposal of the Restaurants Segment

On August 14, 1997 we announced  that our Board of  Directors  approved a formal
plan to spin off our restaurant businesses to our shareholders.  Under the plan,
owners of PepsiCo  capital  stock as of September 19, 1997 received one share of
common stock of the new  restaurant  company,  TRICON Global  Restaurants,  Inc.
(TRICON),  for every ten shares of  PepsiCo  capital  stock.  The  spin-off  was
completed on October 6, 1997 (Distribution  Date). In 1997, we also sold PepsiCo
Food  Systems  (PFS),  the  restaurant  distribution  operation  and  all of the
non-core U.S. restaurant businesses. As a result, the sales, costs and expenses,
assets and  liabilities,  and cash flows of the  Restaurants  segment  have been
classified as discontinued  operations in our financial statements.  See Note 4.
Accordingly,  the discussions that follow focus on the continuing  operations of
our packaged goods businesses.

Market Risk

The principal  market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes
in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are:
   - interest rates on our debt and short-term investment portfolios;
   - foreign exchange rates, generating translation and transaction gains and
     losses and
   - commodity prices, affecting the cost of our products.

Interest Rates

PepsiCo  centrally  manages  its  debt  and  investment  portfolios  considering
investment  opportunities  and risks,  tax  consequences  and overall  financing
strategies.

         We use  interest  rate and  currency  swaps to  effectively  change the
interest  rate and currency of specific  debt  issuances  with the  objective of
reducing our overall  borrowing  costs.  These swaps are generally  entered into
concurrently  with the  issuance of the debt they are  intended  to modify.  The
notional  amount,  interest  payment and  maturity  dates of the swaps match the
principal, interest payment and maturity dates of the related debt. Accordingly,
any market  risk or  opportunity  associated  with these  swaps is offset by the
opposite market impact on the related debt.

         Our investment  portfolios  consist of cash  equivalents and short-term
marketable  securities;  accordingly,  the carrying amounts  approximate  market
value. It is our practice to hold these investments to maturity.

                                       9

<PAGE>

     Assuming  year-end  1997  variable  rate  debt  and  investment  levels,  a
one-point  change in interest  rates would  impact net  interest  expense by $13
million.

Foreign Exchange

Operating  in  international  markets  sometimes  involves  exposure to volatile
movements in currency  exchange rates. The economic impact of currency  exchange
rate  movements  on us is  complex  because  such  changes  are often  linked to
variability in real growth, inflation,  interest rates, governmental actions and
other factors.  These changes, if material, can cause us to adjust our financing
and  operating  strategies.  Consequently,  isolating  the  effect of changes in
currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors.

         International  operations  constitute  about  16%  percent  of our 1997
consolidated  operating  profit,  excluding  unusual items. As currency exchange
rates  change,  translation  of  the  income  statements  of  our  international
businesses into U.S. dollars affects  year-over-year  comparability of operating
results.  We do not generally  hedge  translation  risks because cash flows from
international  operations are generally reinvested locally. We do not enter into
hedges to minimize  volatility of reported earnings because we do not believe it
is justified by the exposure or the cost.

         Changes in currency  exchange  rates that would have the largest impact
on  translating  our  international  operating  profit include the Mexican peso,
British pound, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. We estimate that a 10% change
in foreign  exchange rates would impact reported  operating  profit by less than
$50 million.  This represents 10% of the international  segment operating profit
(disclosed on page F-27) after adjusting for unusual items. We believe that this
quantitative measure has inherent limitations because, as discussed in the first
paragraph  of this  section,  it does not take  into  account  any  governmental
actions or changes in either customer  purchasing  patterns or our financing and
operating strategies.

         Foreign exchange gains and losses reflect  transaction gains and losses
and  translation  gains and  losses  arising  from the  remeasurement  into U.S.
dollars  of the  net  monetary  assets  of  businesses  in  highly  inflationary
countries.   Transaction  gains  and  losses  arise  from  monetary  assets  and
liabilities  denominated in currencies  other than a business unit's  functional
currency.  Net  foreign  exchange  gains and  losses  were not  material  to our
earnings for the last three years.

         The sensitivity analyses presented in the interest and foreign exchange
discussions  above  disregard  the  possibility  that rates can move in opposite
directions  and that gains from one  category may or may not be offset by losses
from another category and vice versa.

Commodities

We are subject to market risk with respect to commodities because our ability to
recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive
environment in which we operate.  We use futures  contracts to hedge  immaterial
amounts of our commodity purchases.

Year 2000

The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer  programs  using two digits rather
than  four  to  define  the  applicable  year.   Computer   programs  that  have
date-sensitive  software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather
than the year 2000.  This could  result in system  failures  or  miscalculations
leading to disruptions in a company's operations.  If either we, our significant
customers or suppliers fail to correct Year 2000 issues, such failure could have
a  significant  impact on our ability to operate our  businesses.  However,  the
impact cannot be quantified at this time.

         We are in the  process of taking  actions to address and  complete  the
work associated with the Year 2000. Each of our business  segments and Corporate
have  established  teams to identify  and  correct  Year 2000  issues.  Internal
software  with  non-compliant  code is  expected  to be fixed or  replaced  with
software  that is Year  2000  compliant.  Similar  attention  is being  given to
technology  infrastructures,  manufacturing  plants and building  facilities  to
achieve  compliance  in all  these  areas.  The  teams  are  also  charged  with
investigating  the Year 2000  capabilities  of  suppliers,  customers  and other
external entities, and with developing contingency plans where necessary.

         An inventory  and  assessment of all computer  systems and  application
software have been completed,  and plans for  establishing  compliance have been
developed in the U.S.  These plans  identify  which  non-compliant  hardware and
software  will be  corrected,  upgraded or replaced;  the timetable and resource
requirements  to  achieve  those  objectives  and  estimated  associated  costs.
Remediation  and  testing  activities  are  under  way at  both  Pepsi-Cola  and
Frito-Lay.  Most  of our  larger  international  operations  have  made  similar
progress,  while  some  of  our  smaller  international  operations,  which  are
generally less automated, are still developing their strategies.

         We do not expect Year 2000 spending to materially  affect  consolidated
profitability or liquidity.  This expectation assumes that our existing forecast
of costs to be incurred  contemplates all significant  actions required and that
we will not be obligated to incur  significant Year 2000 related costs on behalf
of our  customers  or  suppliers.  About  40% of the  total  estimated  spending
represents  replacement  systems that, in addition to being Year 2000 compliant,
provide  significantly  enhanced  capability  which will benefit  operations  in
future years.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Review

Net Sales rose $580 million or 3% in 1997,  reflecting  volume gains,  partially
offset by the impact of unfavorable  currency  translation.  Net sales rose $1.3
billion or 7% in 1996,  reflecting  net volume  gains and higher  effective  net
pricing  (including  the effect of product,  package and country mix) in both of
our  business  segments.  These gains were  partially  offset by an  unfavorable
foreign currency  translation impact.  Volume gains in both years were driven by
worldwide Snack Foods and North American Beverages.

                                       11
<PAGE>

Cost of sales as a percent of net sales  decreased .8 of a point to 40.8 percent
in 1997,  primarily  reflecting  favorable raw material  costs in  International
Beverages  and, the  leveraging  effect of higher  pricing  partially  offset by
increased  costs for new plant  capacity  and the  planned  introduction  of new
products in 1998 by North  American  Snack Foods.  Cost of sales as a percent of
net sales decreased .6 of a point to 41.6 percent in 1996 primarily due to lower
raw materials  costs in North  American  Beverages  coupled with the  leveraging
effect of the higher effective net pricing.

Selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  (SG&A)  comprises  selling and
distribution  expenses (S&D),  advertising and marketing expenses (A&M), general
and administrative expenses (G&A), other income and expense and equity income or
loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates. In 1997, SG&A grew 2%, or at
a slower  rate than  sales.  This  primarily  reflects  equity  income  from our
investments in unconsolidated affiliates, compared to losses a year ago, and A&M
growing at a significantly  slower rate than sales.  The change in equity income
primarily reflects the absence of losses from our Latin American bottler, Buenos
Aires  Embotelladora  S.A. (BAESA).  G&A grew  significantly  faster than sales,
reflecting  information  systems-related  expenses,  customer  focus  leadership
training and  infrastructure  costs related to our new fountain  beverage  sales
team.  These  increased  expenses were partially  offset by savings from a prior
year restructuring and the consolidation of certain administrative functions.

         In  1996,  A&M and S&D  grew  faster  than net  sales,  driving  an 11%
increase  in  SG&A,  led by  International  Beverages.  Equity  losses  from our
unconsolidated affiliates,  compared to equity income in 1995, primarily reflect
our share of operating losses from BAESA.

Amortization  of  intangible  assets  declined 3% to $199 million and 1% to $206
million in 1997 and 1996, respectively.

Unusual  items of $290 million  ($239  million  after-tax or $0.15 per share) in
1997 and $576 million ($527 million after-tax or $0.33 per share) in 1996 relate
to  decisions  to dispose of and write down  assets,  improve  productivity  and
strengthen the international  bottler structure.  See Note 2. The 1995 charge of
$66 million ($64 million  after-tax or $0.04 per share) is the initial,  noncash
impairment charge upon adoption of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
No. 121 (SFAS 121),  "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." See Note 3.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 1997,  reported  operating profit increased $622 million.  Ongoing  operating
profit increased $336 million reflecting segment operating profit growth of $392
million or 14%, partially offset by a $56 million or 32% increase in unallocated
expenses. The increase in segment operating profit primarily reflects the volume
gains and lower raw  material  costs in  worldwide  Beverages.  The  increase in
unallocated  expenses relates to higher corporate  expenses and foreign exchange
losses in 1997 compared to gains in 1996.

         In 1996,  reported  operating  profit  declined $566  million.  Ongoing
operating  profit  decreased $56 million due to a $30 million or 21% increase in
unallocated  expenses and a combined  segment  operating  profit decrease of $26
million  or  1%.  The  increased   unallocated   expenses  relate  to  centrally
administered benefit plans and higher corporate expenses. The decline in segment
operating  profit  reflects  increased  costs in excess of higher  effective net
pricing,  partially  offset by volume  gains.  The  change  in  ongoing  segment
operating profit also includes unfavorable currency translation impacts.

Interest expense, net of interest income, declined $121 million or 26%. Interest
expense declined $87 million or 15% in 1997,  primarily reflecting lower average
U.S.  debt levels.  Debt levels were  reduced  using a portion of the cash flows
provided  by  discontinued   operations  and  proceeds   repatriated   from  our
investments  in Puerto Rico.  The  repatriation  of funds  resulted  from a 1996
change in tax law which  eliminated  a tax  exemption  on  investment  income in
Puerto Rico.  Interest  income  increased $34 million or 37%  reflecting  higher
average  investment  levels,  which also  benefited  from cash flows provided by
discontinued operations.

         Interest expense,  net of interest income in 1996 declined $41 million
or 8%, reflecting lower  international  debt levels and U.S. interest rates.

__________________________________________________________________

Our 1997 reported  effective tax rate decreased 4.4 points to 35.4%. Our ongoing
effective  tax rate  increased  2.0 points to 33.4%,  primarily  reflecting  the
absence of  cumulative  tax  credits  recognized  in 1996 that  related to prior
years,  lower benefits in 1997 from the current year  resolution of prior years'
audit issues and other individually immaterial items.

        Our 1996 reported  effective tax rate increased 7.8 points to 39.8%. Our
ongoing  effective  tax rate  remained  about  even with the prior year as lower
benefits  from the current  year  resolution  of prior  years' audit issues were
offset  by  the  cumulative  tax  credits  related  to  prior  years  and  other
individually immaterial items.

Distribution Date, as well as PFS, the restaurant distribution operation sold in
the second quarter,  and several  non-core U.S.  restaurant  businesses  through
their  respective  disposal dates in 1997.  Reported  operating  results include
expenses  associated with the spin-off and interest  expense directly related to
the Restaurants  segment.  It does not include an allocation of PepsiCo interest

NM - Not Meaningful
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

System bottler case sales (BCS) is our standard  volume  measure.  It represents
PepsiCo-owned  brands  as well as  brands  we have  been  granted  the  right to
produce, distribute and market nationally.


                                  1997 vs. 1996
North America

Net sales  increased $118 million  reflecting  volume  growth,  led by take-home
packaged products, partially offset by lower effective net pricing. The decrease
in  effective  net  pricing  was  primarily  in  take-home   packaged  products,
reflecting an intensely competitive environment.

         BCS  increased  4%,  primarily  reflecting  double-digit  growth by the
Mountain Dew brand.  Non-carbonated soft drink products, led by Aquafina bottled
water and  Lipton  Brisk  tea,  grew at a  double-digit  rate.  Our  concentrate
shipments to franchisees  grew at a slower rate than their BCS growth during the
year.

                                       18
<PAGE>

         Reported  operating  profit  declined $115 million.  Ongoing  operating
profit declined $63 million,  reflecting the lower effective net pricing, higher
S&D costs and increased A&M. S&D grew  significantly  faster than sales,  but in
line with volume. A&M grew significantly faster than sales and volume, primarily
reflecting above average levels of expenditures  late in 1997. These unfavorable
items  were  partially  offset  by the  volume  gains and  lower  packaging  and
commodity costs. G&A savings from centralizing certain administrative  functions
were fully offset by Year 2000  spending and  infrastructure  development  costs
related  to our new  fountain  beverage  sales  team.  The  decline  in  ongoing
operating profit also reflects lapping 1996 gains from the sale of an investment
in a bottling cooperative and a settlement made with a supplier.

International

Net sales  declined $164 million.  The decline was due to  unfavorable  currency
translation  effects,  primarily  driven by Spain and Japan.

         BCS increased 1%. Strong  double-digit growth in China, the Philippines
and India was partially offset by double-digit declines in Brazil, Venezuela and
South Africa.  The declines in Venezuela and South Africa  reflect the impact of
the unexpected loss of our bottler in August 1996 and the cessation of our joint
venture operation,  respectively.  In November 1996, we entered into a new joint
venture to replace  the  Venezuelan  bottler.  Total  concentrate  shipments  to
franchisees increased at about the same rate as their BCS.

         Reported  operating  losses  declined $693 million.  Ongoing  operating
results improved by $271 million,  reflecting a small profit in 1997 compared to
a loss in 1996.  The increase in ongoing  operating  results was driven by lower
manufacturing  costs,  reduced net losses from our investments in unconsolidated
affiliates  and lower G&A expenses.  Operating  results also  benefited from the
lapping of 1996's higher-than-normal  expenses from fourth quarter balance sheet
adjustments  and actions.  The lower  manufacturing  costs were primarily due to
favorable  raw  material  costs and lower  depreciation  resulting  from certain
businesses  held for  disposal.  The reduced net losses from our  unconsolidated
affiliates were primarily  driven by the absence of losses from BAESA. The lower
G&A expenses reflect savings from our fourth quarter 1996 restructuring of about
$70 million.

<PAGE>

                                  1996 vs. 1995
North America

Net sales rose $307 million.  The gain reflects volume growth, led by carbonated
soft drink products, and higher effective net pricing.

         BCS increased 4%, with solid  increases in Brand Pepsi and the Mountain
Dew brand. Non-carbonated soft drink products, led by Aquafina bottled water and
Hawaiian Punch fountain  syrup,  grew at a  double-digit  rate. Our  concentrate
shipments to franchisees grew at a slightly faster rate than their BCS growth.

         Operating profit increased $174 million. The growth reflects the volume
gains,  lower product costs and the higher  effective net pricing.  A&M expenses
grew  significantly  faster  than  sales,  primarily  due  to  the  Pepsi  Stuff
promotion. S&D expenses grew at the same rate as sales and volume. Profit growth
was aided by  lapping  charges  taken in 1995,  primarily  for  losses on supply
contracts,   take-or-pay  co-packing  penalties  and  a  write  down  of  excess
co-packing  assets.  A 1996  gain on the  sale of an  investment  in a  bottling
cooperative  and a 1996  settlement  with a supplier for purchases made in prior
years also helped profit growth.

         Benefits  of  approximately  $130  million  related  to the  1992  U.S.
restructuring  were achieved in 1996 due to the centralization of purchasing and
improved   administrative  and  business   processes.   All  benefits  from  the
restructuring will be reinvested in the business.

International

In 1996 we began to  implement  a new  strategy  to focus on  building  our core
business  in markets  in which we are  already  strong  and in certain  emerging
markets. Decisions were made accordingly to dispose of certain businesses and to
restructure  operations,  resulting  in  unusual  impairment  and  restructuring
charges.  Liabilities  associated with the restructuring charge were expected to
be paid by the end of 1997 and the  restructuring was expected to generate about
$50 million in savings in 1997 and about $80 million a year thereafter.

         Net sales declined $187 million,  primarily due to unfavorable currency
translation  impacts  and  lower  volume.  The  volume  decline  reflects  lower
concentrate  shipments  to  franchisees,  partially  offset by  higher  packaged
product sales to retailers.

         BCS decreased 2%.  Excluding the impact of the  unexpected  loss of our
Venezuelan bottler, BCS declined 1%. A single-digit decline in Latin America was
partially  offset  by  strong  double-digit  growth  in  China  and  India.  Our
concentrate  shipments to franchisees  declined at a  significantly  faster rate
than their BCS decline.

                                       20
<PAGE>

         Reported  operating  results declined $958 million.  Ongoing  operating
results  declined $382 million.  The decline reflects  broad-based  increases in
A&M,  higher-than-normal  expenses from fourth quarter balance sheet adjustments
and  actions,  increased  net losses from our  unconsolidated  affiliates  and a
decline in volume. The increased net losses from our  unconsolidated  affiliates
were driven by our equity share of BAESA's operating losses.

in 1997 (see Note 2).  Unless  otherwise  noted,  operating  profit  comparisons
within the following discussions are based on ongoing operating profit.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pound and kilo sales are our standard volume measures. Pound and kilo growth are
reported on a systemwide basis, which includes both consolidated  businesses and
unconsolidated affiliates operating for at least one year.

                                       21

<PAGE>

                                  1997 vs. 1996
North America

Net sales grew $339  million  reflecting  increased  volume  and the  benefit of
higher pricing taken on most major brands late in 1996.

     Pound  volume  advanced  3%.  Growth of our core  brands,  excluding  their
low-fat and no-fat versions,  was led by high single-digit growth in Lay's brand
potato chips,  strong  double-digit  growth by Tostitos brand tortilla chips and
single-digit  growth by Doritos brand tortilla  chips.  Baked Lay's brand potato
crisps reported low double-digit  growth;  however, the remainder of our low-fat
and no-fat snacks business depressed the overall growth rate.

     Reported operating profit grew $128 million.  Ongoing operating profit rose
$150 million,  reflecting the higher pricing and volume growth, partially offset
by increased  manufacturing costs and G&A expenses. The increased  manufacturing
costs relate to new plant capacity and the planned  introduction of new products
in 1998. S&D grew slower than sales,  A&M was about even with prior year and G&A
increased significantly faster than sales reflecting information systems-related
expenses and customer focus  leadership  training.  Operating  profit growth was
hampered by lapping a 1996 gain from the sale of a non-core business.

International

Net sales increased $287 million  reflecting  volume gains and higher  effective
net pricing.

     Salty snack kilos rose 11%, led by strong  double-digit  growth by Sabritas
and our business in Brazil, while sweet snack kilos declined 5%, due to a market
contraction at Gamesa.

     Reported  operating profit decreased $28 million.  Ongoing operating profit
increased $34 million.  The increase  primarily  reflects volume gains partially
offset by increased  G&A. The higher  effective  net pricing was fully offset by
inflation-driven  higher operating and manufacturing costs, primarily in Mexico.
Ongoing  operating  profit also  benefited  from the gain on the sale of a flour
mill.

                                  1996 vs. 1995
North America

Net sales grew $755  million.  The increase  reflects  strong  volume growth and
higher  effective net pricing taken across all core brands in late 1995 and late
1996.

         Pound volume advanced 9%, reflecting  exceptional  performance from the
low-fat and no-fat  categories.  These  categories  contributed  over 45% of the
total pound  growth,  led by Baked  Lay's  brand  potato  crisps.  Core  brands,
excluding their low-fat and no-fat versions, had mid-single-digit  growth led by
double-digit  growth in Lay's brand potato chips and strong  double-digit growth
in Tostitos brand tortilla chips.

                                       22
<PAGE>

         Operating  profit grew $137 million.  The increase  reflects the volume
growth  and  the  higher  effective  net  pricing,   which  exceeded   increased
promotional  price  allowances  and  merchandising  support.  The growth rate of
promotional price allowances  moderated in the fourth quarter.  These gains were
partially  offset by higher  operating  and  manufacturing  costs and  increased
administrative expenses. The increased operating costs reflect increased S&D and
A&M.  S&D  and  manufacturing   costs  both  reflect  capacity  costs  and  some
inefficiencies  incurred  to  capture  the  volume  opportunities  created  when
Anheuser-Busch exited the salty snack food business.  These inefficiencies began
to moderate in the fourth quarter.  The increase in operating  expenses  coupled
with  higher G&A  expenses,  partially  reflect  investment  spending to sustain
strong volume growth.  This increased  investment  spending,  including costs of
developing and testing new products,  was partially offset by a gain on the sale
of a non-core business.

International

Net sales  increased $395 million.  This growth reflects  inflation-based  price
increases  in Mexico  and  volume  growth,  partially  offset by an  unfavorable
currency translation impact, led by the peso.

         Salty snack kilos rose 8%, reflecting  double-digit  growth at Sabritas
and strong single-digit growth in the U.K. Sweet snack kilos declined 2%, led by
a  single-digit  decline  at  Gamesa,  due  to  marketwide  contraction,  and  a
double-digit decline at Alegro, the sweet snack division of Sabritas.

         Operating  profit increased $45 million.  The increase  reflects higher
effective net pricing in advance of inflation-driven  product and operating cost
increases,  primarily in Mexico,  and the  increased  volumes.  These gains were
partially  offset by increased  administrative  expenses and the net unfavorable
currency  translation  impact.  A&M  expenses  increased,  partially  reflecting
investment in global advertising and design.

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS

PepsiCo's 1997  consolidated  cash and cash  equivalents  increased $1.6 billion
over the prior year  reflecting  a  significant  increase  in cash  provided  by
discontinued  operations,  partially offset by increased cash outflows to reduce
debt, increase our investment portfolios and repurchase shares.

         Net cash  provided by operating  activities  rose $227 million or 7% to
$3.4 billion in 1997,  driven by increased income before all noncash charges and
credits.  Cash flow growth  from  operating  working  capital was reduced by the
year-over-year  change  in  accounts  payable  and  other  current  liabilities,
primarily due to lapping  restructuring  accruals recorded in the fourth quarter
of 1996.

         Net cash used for investing  activities  nearly doubled in 1997 to $2.1
billion,  primarily reflecting a $1.5 billion swing in our short-term investment
portfolio activity,  partially offset by $178 million of increased proceeds from
sales of businesses and reduced

                                       23

<PAGE>

capital  spending  of $124  million.  The  change in our  short-term  investment
portfolio  activity  primarily  reflects  investing  a portion of the cash flows
provided by discontinued  operations.  This compares to 1996 when we repatriated
the  proceeds  from our maturing  investments  in Puerto Rico as a result of the
Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. This tax law eliminated our exemption
from U.S. Federal income tax on investment  income generated in Puerto Rico. The
repatriated proceeds were used to reduce outstanding  commercial paper debt. The
cash  flow from  sales of  businesses  in 1997  primarily  reflects  the sale of
international bottling operations and our investment in a non-core international
snack food business.  Lower capital  spending was driven by North American Snack
Foods.  The decline  reflects the lapping of 1996 capital  spending  incurred to
capture volume opportunities  created when Anheuser-Busch exited the salty snack
food business,  partially offset by 1997 new product-related spending.  Spending
on  acquisitions  and  investments in  unconsolidated  affiliates is expected to
increase in 1998.

         Net cash  used for  financing  activities  more  than  doubled  to $6.0
billion in 1997. The increase  primarily  reflects increased net debt repayments
of $2.5 billion and share repurchases.

At December  27,  1997,  132 million  shares  were  available  under the current
repurchase authority granted by our Board of Directors.

         Net cash  flow  provided  by  discontinued  operations  increased  $5.6
billion in 1997. The significant increase primarily reflects a $4.5 billion cash
distribution  received  from TRICON just prior to the  Restaurant  spin-off.  In
addition,  it reflects  after-tax cash proceeds of $1.0 billion  associated with
the sale of PFS and the  non-core  U.S.  restaurant  businesses,  the effects of
refranchising restaurants and other operating activities.

Free Cash Flow

Free  cash  flow is a  measure  we use  internally  to  evaluate  our cash  flow
performance  and should be  considered  in addition  to, but not as a substitute
for,  other  measures of financial  performance  in  accordance  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles.  These funds  provide us with  flexibility  to
reduce our debt outstanding, repurchase shares or make strategic investments and
acquisitions.

The $6.3  billion  increase  in free  cash  flow in 1997  largely  reflects  our
strategic  initiative to exit the restaurant  business.  In addition,  free cash
flow from  continuing  operations  nearly  doubled with improved cash flows from
operating  activities,  larger proceeds  arising from the sale of businesses and
reduced  capital   spending.   Both  continuing  and   discontinued   operations
contributed to the $268 million or 25% increase in the 1996 free cash flow.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At year-end 1997,  $2.1 billion of short-term  borrowings  were  reclassified as
long-term,  reflecting  our intent and  ability,  through the  existence  of our
unused revolving credit  facilities,  to refinance these borrowings.  Our unused
credit  facilities,  which exist  largely to support the issuances of short-term
debt,   were  $2.75  billion  and  $3.5  billion  at  year-end  1997  and  1996,
respectively. Annually, these facilities can be extended an additional year upon
the mutual  consent of PepsiCo  and the  lending  institutions.  We reduced  our
credit  facilities by $750 million at year-end  1997 due to decreased  borrowing
needs.

         Our net  debt  level,  which  reflects  the  pro  forma  remittance  of
investment  portfolios  (net of related taxes) as a reduction of total debt, and
leverage  at year-end  1997 were lower than prior  years.  We plan to  gradually
releverage over time.

         Our strong  cash-generating  capability and financial condition give us
ready access to capital markets throughout the world.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(tabular dollars in millions except per share amounts; all per share
amounts assume dilution)

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The  preparation of the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and  assumptions  that affect  reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
     Certain  reclassifications  were made to prior year amounts to conform with
the  1997  presentation,   including  classifying  our  Restaurants  segment  as
discontinued  operations.  The consolidated  financial  statements for all years
have been restated. See Note 4.
     Principles  of  Consolidation.   The  financial   statements   reflect  the
consolidated   accounts  of  PepsiCo,   Inc.  and  its  controlled   affiliates.
Intercompany  accounts and  transactions  have been  eliminated.  Investments in
unconsolidated  affiliates in which PepsiCo exercises  significant influence but
not control are accounted  for by the equity  method and PepsiCo's  share of the
net income or loss of its  unconsolidated  affiliates  is  included  in selling,
general and administrative expenses.
     Marketing  Costs.  Marketing  costs are  reported in  selling,  general and
administrative  expenses and include costs of  advertising  and other  marketing
activities.  Marketing  costs not  deferred at  year-end  are charged to expense
ratably  in  relation  to sales  over the  year in which  incurred.  Advertising
expenses  were $1.8  billion,  $1.8 billion and $1.4  billion in 1997,  1996 and
1995,  respectively.  Advertising  expenses  deferred  at  year-end,  which  are
classified  as prepaid  expenses in the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet,  were $53
million and $37  million in 1997 and 1996,  respectively.  Deferred  advertising
consists  of  media  and  personal  service  advertising-  related  prepayments,
promotional  materials  in  inventory  and  production  costs  of  future  media
advertising; these assets are expensed in the year first used.
     Stock-Based Compensation. PepsiCo measures stock-based compensation cost as
the excess of the quoted  market price of PepsiCo's  capital  stock at the grant
date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock. PepsiCo's policy is to
generally  grant  stock  options  at fair  market  value at the  date of  grant;
accordingly, no compensation cost is incurred.
     Derivative Instruments. The interest differential to be paid or received on
an interest rate swap is recognized as an adjustment to interest  expense as the
differential  occurs.  The  interest  differential  not yet  settled  in cash is
reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a receivable or payable under the
appropriate  current  asset or  liability  caption.  If an  interest  rate  swap
position was to be terminated,  the gain or loss realized upon termination would
be deferred and  amortized to interest  expense over the  remaining  term of the
underlying  debt  instrument  it was  intended to modify or would be  recognized
immediately if the underlying debt instrument was settled prior to maturity.
     The  differential  to be paid or  received  on a currency  swap  related to
non-U.S. dollar denominated debt is charged or credited to income as the

F - 8
<PAGE>
differential  occurs.  This is fully  offset by the  corresponding  gain or loss
recognized  in income on the currency  translation  of the debt, as both amounts
are based  upon the same  exchange  rates.  The  currency  differential  not yet
settled  in cash is  reflected  in the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet  under  the
appropriate  current or noncurrent  receivable or payable caption. If a currency
swap position was to be terminated prior to maturity,  the gain or loss realized
upon termination would be immediately recognized in income.
     Gains  and  losses  on  futures  contracts  designated  as hedges of future
commodity  purchases  are  deferred  and included in the cost of the related raw
materials  when  purchased.  Changes in the value of futures  contracts  used to
hedge commodity  purchases are highly  correlated to the changes in the value of
the  purchased  commodity.  If the degree of  correlation  between  the  futures
contracts and the purchased commodity were to ever significantly diminish during
the  contract  term,  subsequent  changes in the value of the futures  contracts
would be recognized in income.
     Cash Equivalents.  Cash equivalents  represent funds temporarily  invested,
with  original  maturities  not  exceeding  three  months,  as part of PepsiCo's
management of day-to-day  operating cash receipts and  disbursements.  All other
investment portfolios are primarily classified as short-term investments.
     Inventories.  Inventories  are valued at the lower of cost (computed on the
average,  first-in,  first-out or last-in,  first-out  method) or net realizable
value.
     Property,  Plant and Equipment.  Property,  plant and equipment  (PP&E) are
stated at cost, except for PP&E that have been impaired,  for which the carrying
amount is reduced to estimated net realizable value.  Depreciation is calculated
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
     Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis
over appropriate periods, generally ranging from 20 to 40 years.
     Recoverability  of  Long-Lived  Assets to be Held and Used in the Business.
All long-lived  assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 121 (SFAS  121),  "Accounting  for the
Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of."
Assets are generally grouped at the country level, by segment, for this purpose.
     An impaired  asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based
on the best  information  available;  estimated  fair market  value is generally
measured by discounting  estimated  future cash flows.  Considerable  management
judgment is necessary  to estimate  discounted  future cash flows.  Accordingly,
actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 1997 and 1996 unusual items include  impairment  charges of $200 million and
$373 million, respectively,  (see Note 3). The 1997 net charge to strengthen the
international bottler structure includes proceeds of $87 million associated with
a settlement  related to a previous  Venezuelan  bottler  agreement,  which were
partially offset by related costs.
     The 1995 initial,  noncash  charge  reflects the early adoption of SFAS 121
(see Note 3).

                                            $ 200      $ 373     $  66
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The charges associated with assets to be held and used in the business reflect a
reduction  in  forecasted  cash  flows  attributable  to  increased  competitive
activity and weakened  macroeconomic  factors in various geographic regions. The
net charges for  disposal of assets  primarily  reflect  strategic  decisions to
realign the  international  bottling  system,  restructure  certain  Snack Foods
operations and exit certain businesses.  We anticipate the disposal of assets to
be completed in 1998.

F - 10
<PAGE>
     PepsiCo early adopted SFAS 121 as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of
1995. The initial,  noncash charge  resulted from PepsiCo  grouping  assets at a
lower  level than  under its  previous  accounting  policy  for  evaluating  and
measuring impairment.


Note 4 - Discontinued Operations

The Restaurants segment was composed of the core restaurant  businesses of Pizza
Hut, Taco Bell and KFC, PepsiCo Food Systems (PFS), the restaurant  distribution
operation,  and several non-core U.S.  restaurant  businesses.  In 1997, PepsiCo
announced  its  intention  to  spin  off  its   restaurant   businesses  to  its
shareholders as an independent  publicly traded company  (Distribution) and sell
PFS separately. The spin-off was effective as a tax free Distribution on October
6, 1997 (Distribution Date). Owners of PepsiCo capital stock as of September 19,
1997  received  one share of common  stock of TRICON  Global  Restaurants,  Inc.
(TRICON),  the new company,  for every ten shares of PepsiCo capital stock. Just
prior to the  Distribution  Date,  PepsiCo  received  $4.5  billion in cash from
TRICON as repayment of certain amounts due and a dividend.  PFS and the non-core
U.S. restaurant businesses were sold prior to the Distribution Date resulting in
after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion.

Income from discontinued operations:

                                      1997        1996      1995
Net sales                          $ 8,375    $ 11,441  $ 11,328
Costs and expenses                  (7,704)    (10,935)  (10,946)
PFS gain                               500           -         -
Interest expense, net                  (20)        (25)      (40)
Provision for income taxes            (500)       (274)     (158)
Income from discontinued
 operations                        $   651    $    207  $    184


The above amounts include costs directly associated with the spin-off but do not
include  an  allocation  of  PepsiCo  interest  or  general  and  administrative
expenses.


Note 5 - Income Per Share

PepsiCo  adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
No. 128, "Earnings Per Share," in 1997. Application of its provisions results in
disclosure of two income per share measures, basic and assuming dilution, on the
face of the Consolidated Statement of Income.

      PepsiCo's  reported  net income  represents  its net income  available  to
common  stockholders  for purposes of computing  both  measures.  The  following
reconciles  shares  outstanding  at the beginning of the year to average  shares
outstanding used to compute both income per share measures.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identifiable  intangible  assets primarily arise from the allocation of purchase
prices of businesses acquired. Amounts assigned to such identifiable intangibles
are based on independent  appraisals or internal estimates.  Goodwill represents
the residual purchase price after allocation to all identifiable net assets.
     The above amounts are net of accumulated  amortization  of $1.7 billion and
$1.5 billion at year-end 1997 and 1996, respectively.

The interest rates in the above table include the effects of associated interest
rate and currency  swaps at year-end 1997 and 1996. See Note 11 for a discussion

inherent  credit risk and fair value  information  related to debt and  interest
rate and currency swaps.

     The  following  table  indicates the notional  amount and weighted  average
interest rates, by category, of interest rate swaps outstanding at year-end 1997
and 1996,  respectively.  The  weighted  average  variable  interest  rates that
PepsiCo pays,  which are primarily  indexed to either  commercial paper or LIBOR
rates,  are  based on  rates as of the  respective  balance  sheet  date and are
subject to change. Terms of interest rate swaps match the terms of the debt they
modify. The swaps terminate at various dates through 2011.

At  year-end  1997,  approximately  77% of total debt was  exposed  to  variable
interest rates,  compared to 74% in 1996. In addition to variable rate long-term
debt, all debt with  maturities of less than one year is categorized as variable
for purposes of this measure.
     PepsiCo  enters  into  currency  swaps to hedge its  currency  exposure  on
certain  non-U.S.  dollar  denominated  debt.  At year-end  1997,  the aggregate
carrying  amount of the debt was $629  million and the  payables  under  related
currency  swaps were $104  million,  resulting in a net  effective  U.S.  dollar
liability  of $733  million  with a  weighted  average  interest  rate of  5.8%,
including the effects of related  interest  rate swaps.  At year-end  1996,  the
carrying  amount of this debt  aggregates  $1.8 billion and the  receivables and
payables  under related  currency  swaps  aggregate $54 million and $59 million,
respectively, resulting in a net effective U.S. dollar liability of $1.8 billion
with a weighted average interest rate of 5.6%,  including the effects of related
interest rate swaps.
     At year-end 1997 and 1996,  PepsiCo's unused  revolving  credit  facilities
covering  potential   borrowings  aggregate  $2.75  billion  and  $3.5  billion,
respectively.  The 1997 facilities expire in 2002. These credit facilities exist
largely to support the issuances of short-term  borrowings and are available for
general corporate purposes.
     At year-end 1997 and 1996, $2.1 billion and $3.5 billion,  respectively, of
short-term  borrowings were classified as long-term debt,  reflecting  PepsiCo's
intent and ability,  through the existence of the unused credit  facilities,  to
refinance these borrowings.
     The  annual  maturities  of  long-term  debt  through  2002 are:  1998-$2.1
billion,  1999-$939 million, 2000-$746 million, 2001-$353 million and 2002- $330
million.

Note 11 - Financial Instruments

Derivative Instruments
PepsiCo's  policy  prohibits  the  use of  derivative  instruments  for  trading
purposes and PepsiCo has procedures in place to monitor and control their use.
     PepsiCo's use of derivative  instruments  is primarily  limited to interest
rate and currency  swaps,  which are entered into with the objective of reducing
borrowing  costs.  PepsiCo  enters  into  interest  rate and  currency  swaps to
effectively  change the interest rate and currency of specific  debt  issuances.
These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt they are
intended to modify. The notional amount,  interest payment and maturity dates of
the swaps  match the  principal,  interest  payment  and  maturity  dates of the
related debt. Accordingly,  any market risk or opportunity associated with these
swaps is offset by the opposite  market  impact on the related  debt.  PepsiCo's
credit risk  related to  interest  rate and  currency  swaps is  considered  low
because they are entered into only with strong creditworthy counterparties,  are
generally settled on a net basis and are of relatively short duration.  See Note
10 for the  notional  amounts,  related  interest  rates and  maturities  of the
interest rate and currency  swaps.  See  Management's  Discussion and Analysis -
Market Risk beginning on page 9.

The carrying amounts in the above table are included in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet  under  the  indicated  captions,   except  for  debt-related   derivative
instruments  (interest  rate and  currency  swaps),  which are  included  in the
appropriate  current  or  noncurrent  asset  or  liability  caption.  Short-term
investments  consist  primarily of debt  securities and have been  classified as
held-to-maturity. Noncurrent investments mature at various dates through 2000.
     Because  of  the  short  maturity  of  cash   equivalents   and  short-term
investments,  the carrying  amounts  approximate  fair value.  The fair value of
noncurrent  investments is based upon market quotes.  The fair value of debt and
debt-related  derivative  instruments  was  estimated  using  market  quotes and
calculations based on market rates.

Note 13 - Employee Stock Options

PepsiCo granted stock options to employees pursuant to three different incentive
plans - the SharePower Stock Option Plan (SharePower),  the Long- Term Incentive
Plan (LTIP) and the Stock Option Incentive Plan (SOIP). SharePower stock options
were  granted to  essentially  all  full-time  employees.  The number of options
granted was based on each  employee's  annual  earnings.  The options  generally
became exercisable  ratably over 5 years and had to be exercised within 10 years
of the grant date.


F - 17
<PAGE>
    Under the SOIP and LTIP,  stock  options  were  granted to middle and senior
management employees,  respectively.  SOIP options were exercisable after 1 year
and had to be  exercised  within 10 years of the grant date.  Most LTIP  options
were  exercisable  after 4 years and had to be exercised  within 10 years of the
grant date.  In addition,  certain LTIP options  could be exchanged by employees
for a specified  number of performance  share units (PSUs) within 60 days of the
grant date. The value of a PSU was fixed at the value of a share of stock at the
grant date and vested 4 years from the grant date, contingent upon attainment of
prescribed  Corporate  performance goals. At year-end 1997, 1996 and 1995, there
were 801,000,  763,000 and 970,600 PSUs  outstanding,  respectively.  Payment of
PSUs are made in cash and/or stock as approved by the Compensation  Committee of
PepsiCo's Board of Directors. Amounts expensed in continuing operations for PSUs
were $4 million in both 1997 and 1996 and $5 million in 1995. At year-end  1997,
there were 41 million and 137 million shares  available for grant under the SOIP
and LTIP, respectively.

Without the effect of pro forma costs related to the modification of outstanding
options  arising  from the TRICON  spin-off,  pro forma  income from  continuing
operations is $1,436 million or $0.92 per share in 1997.
     The pro forma amounts  disclosed above are not fully  representative of the
effects of stock-based awards because they exclude the pro forma cost related to
the unvested stock options granted before 1995.
     The fair value of the  options  granted  (including  the  modification)  is
estimated using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model based on the following
weighted average assumptions:

Note 14 - Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions

PepsiCo  provides  postretirement  health  care  benefits  to  eligible  retired
employees and their  dependents,  principally  in the U.S.  Retirees who have 10
years of service and attain age 55 while in service with PepsiCo are eligible to
participate in the  postretirement  benefit plans.  The plans are not funded and
include some retiree cost sharing beginning in 1993.
     Postretirement benefit expense for 1997, 1996 and 1995 was $34 million, $39
million and $36 million, respectively.

Postretirement benefit liability recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet:

benefit obligation were 7.4% and 7.8% in 1997 and 1996, respectively.
     Separate  assumed  health care cost trend rates are used for  employees who
retire before and after retiree cost sharing was introduced.  The assumed health
care cost trend rate for employees who retired  before cost sharing was 7.4% for
1998, declining gradually to 5.5% in 2005 and thereafter. For employees retiring
after  the  introduction  of cost  sharing,  the  trend  rate was 6.5% for 1998,
declining to zero in 2004 and thereafter.


Note 15 - Pension Plans

     PepsiCo  sponsors  noncontributory  defined  benefit pension plans covering
substantially  all  full-time  U.S.   employees  as  well  as  contributory  and
noncontributory  defined  benefit pension plans covering  certain  international
employees.  Benefits generally are based on years of service and compensation or
stated amounts for each year of service. PepsiCo funds the U.S. plans in amounts
not less than minimum statutory  funding  requirements nor more than the maximum
amount that can be deducted for U.S.  income tax purposes.  International  plans
are funded in amounts  sufficient to comply with local  statutory  requirements.
The plans' assets  consist  principally  of equity  securities,  government  and
corporate debt securities and other  fixed-income  obligations.  The U.S. plans'
assets include 11.7 million and 12.2 million shares of PepsiCo  capital stock in
1997 and 1996,  with a post-spin  adjusted market value of $436 million and $316
million,  respectively.  In the interest of maintaining an appropriate  level of
diversification  within the U.S.  plans'  asset  portfolio,  .5 million  and 1.5
million shares of PepsiCo  capital stock were sold during the 1997 and 1996 plan
years,  respectively.  Dividends on PepsiCo  capital  stock of $6 million and $5
million were received by the U.S. plans in 1997 and 1996, respectively.

Note 16 - Contingencies

PepsiCo  is subject to various  claims and  contingencies  related to  lawsuits,
taxes,  environmental  and other  matters  arising  out of the normal  course of
business.  Management believes that the ultimate liability, if any, in excess of
amounts  already  recognized  arising from such claims or  contingencies  is not
likely  to have a  material  adverse  effect  on  PepsiCo's  annual  results  of
operations or financial condition.

Management's Responsibility for Financial Statements

To Our Shareholders:

Management is  responsible  for the  reliability of the  consolidated  financial
statements  and  related  notes,  which have been  prepared in  conformity  with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and include  amounts based upon our
estimates  and  assumptions,  as required.  The financial  statements  have been
audited and reported on by our independent auditors,  KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, who
were given free access to all  financial  records and  related  data,  including
minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors  and  Committees of the Board.
We believe that management representations made to the independent auditors were
valid and appropriate.
     PepsiCo  maintains a system of internal  control over financial  reporting,
designed to provide reasonable  assurance as to the reliability of the financial
statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition.
The system is supported by formal policies and  procedures,  including an active
Code of Conduct  program  intended  to ensure  employees  adhere to the  highest
standards of personal  and  professional  integrity.  PepsiCo's  internal  audit
function  monitors  and  reports  on the  adequacy  of and  compliance  with the
internal  control  system,   and  appropriate   actions  are  taken  to  address
significant  control  deficiencies  and other  opportunities  for  improving the
system as they are  identified.  The Audit  Committee of the Board of Directors,
which is  composed  solely  of  outside  directors,  provides  oversight  to our
financial  reporting  process  and our  controls  to  safeguard  assets  through
periodic  meetings  with  our  independent   auditors,   internal  auditors  and
management. Both our independent auditors and internal auditors have free access
to the Audit Committee.
     Although no cost-effective internal control system will preclude all errors
and  irregularities,  we believe our  controls as of December  27, 1997  provide
reasonable  assurance  that the financial  statements  are reliable and that our
assets are reasonably safeguarded.

Report of Independent Auditors


Board of Directors and Shareholders
PepsiCo, Inc.


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of PepsiCo, Inc. and
Subsidiaries  as of  December  27,  1997 and  December  28, 1996 and the related
consolidated  statements of income, cash flows and shareholders' equity for each
of  the  years  in  the  three-year   period  ended  December  27,  1997.  These
consolidated  financial  statements are the  responsibility  of PepsiCo,  Inc.'s
management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
     We conducted  our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
     In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of PepsiCo,
Inc. and  Subsidiaries  as of December  27, 1997 and December 28, 1996,  and the
results  of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 27, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
     As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated  financial statements,  PepsiCo,
Inc. in 1995  adopted  the  provisions  of the  Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of."

(in millions except per share and employee amounts, unaudited)
PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PepsiCo  disposed of its  Restaurants  segment in 1997 and  accounted  for it as
discontinued  operations  (see Note 4); all  information  has been  reclassified
accordingly.  Additionally,  PepsiCo made  numerous  acquisitions  in most years
presented and a few  divestitures  in certain years.  Such  transactions  do not
materially  affect the  comparability  of  PepsiCo's  operating  results for the
periods  presented.  All share and per share amounts reflect a two-for-one stock
split  in  1996  and  per  share  amounts  are  computed  using  average  shares
outstanding, assuming dilution.

(a)  Includes  unusual items of $290 ($239  after-tax or $0.15 per share)in 1997
     and $576 ($527 after-tax or $0.33 per share) in 1996. See Note 2.
(b)  Includes the  initial,  noncash  charge of $66 ($64  after-tax or $0.04 per
     share) upon adoption of SFAS 121 at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
(c)  Includes the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 112 "Employers'  Accounting
     for Postemployment  Benefits" of $77 ($51 after-tax or $0.03 per share) and
     changing to a preferable method for calculating the market-related value of
     plan assets used in determining  the return-on-  asset  component of annual
     pension expense and the cumulative net unrecognized gain or loss subject to
     amortization  of $32 ($20 after- tax or $0.01 per share).  Prior years were
     not restated for these changes in accounting.
(d)  Includes a benefit of changing to the preferable method for calculating the
     market  value of plan  assets in 1994,  which  reduced  full  year  pension
     expense by $29 ($18 after-tax or $0.01 per share).
(e)  Fiscal year 1994 consists of 53 weeks. Normally, fiscal years consist of 52
     weeks;  however,  because  the  fiscal  year ends on the last  Saturday  in
     December,  a week is  added  every 5 or 6  years.  The  fifty-  third  week
     increased  1994 earnings by  approximately  $31 ($28 after-tax or $0.02 per
     share).
(f)  Defined as earnings before interest,  taxes,  depreciation and amortization
     which is presented  net of the noncash  portion of unusual items of $233 in
     1997, $366 in 1996 and $66 in 1995.  EBITDA is used by certain investors as
     a  measure  of a  company's  ability  to  service  its  debt.  It should be
     considered in addition to, but not as a substitute  for,  other measures of
     financial  performance  in accordance  with generally  accepted  accounting
     principles (GAAP).
(g)  Defined  as net cash  provided  by  operating  activities  reduced  by cash
     dividends paid and adjusted for the following investing activities: capital
     spending,  sales of businesses,  sales of property, plant and equipment and
     other,  net. Free cash flow is a measure we use  internally to evaluate our
     cash flow performance and should be considered in addition to, but not as a
     substitute for, other measures of financial  performance in accordance with
     GAAP.

(h)  Represents historically reported market price of one share of PepsiCo, Inc.
     capital stock.
(i)  Represents approximately 92% of the historical market price of one share of

                                    ARTICLE I

                                  INTRODUCTION

            PepsiCo,  Inc. (the  "Company")  established  the PepsiCo  Executive
Income Deferral  Program in 1972 to permit eligible  executives to defer certain
cash awards made under its executive  compensation programs.  Subsequently,  the
PepsiCo  Executive  Income Deferral  Program (the "Plan") was expanded to permit
eligible  executives to defer base pay,  certain  other  categories of executive
compensation and gains on Performance Share Stock Options.

            Except as otherwise provided,  this document sets forth the terms of
the Plan as in effect on July 1, 1997.  As of that date,  it specifies the group
of executives of the Company and certain  affiliated  employers eligible to make
deferrals,  the  procedures  for electing to defer  compensation  and the Plan's
provisions  for  maintaining  and paying out  amounts  that have been  deferred.
Additional  provisions  applicable  to certain  executives  are set forth in the
Appendix, which modifies and supplements the general provisions of the Plan.

            The Plan is unfunded and unsecured. Amounts deferred by an executive
are an obligation of that executive's  individual employer.  With respect to his

                                   DEFINITIONS

            When used in this Plan,  the following  underlined  terms shall have
the meanings set forth below unless a different  meaning is plainly  required by
the context:

The  account  maintained  for a  Participant  on the  books of his  Employer  to
determine,  from time to time, the  Participant's  interest under this Plan. The
balance in such Account  shall be  determined  by the Plan  Administrator.  Each
Participant's Account shall consist of at least one Deferral Subaccount for each
separate deferral under Section 3.2. In accordance with Section 4.3, some or all
of a separate deferral may be held in a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount.  The Plan
Administrator  may  also  establish  such  additional  subaccounts  as it  deems
necessary  for the  proper  administration  of the Plan.  Where  appropriate,  a
reference  to  a  Participant's  Account  shall  include  a  reference  to  each
applicable subaccount that has been established thereunder.

adjusted base salary, as determined by the Plan  Administrator and to the extent
paid in U.S. dollars from an Employer's U.S. payroll. For any applicable payroll
period,  an eligible  Employee's  adjusted base salary shall be determined after
reductions for  applicable  tax  withholdings,  Employee  authorized  deductions
(including deductions for SaveUp,  Benefits Plus and charitable donations),  tax
levies, garnishments and such other amounts as the Plan Administrator recognizes
as reducing the amount of base salary available for deferral.

:  An  eligible  Employee's  adjusted  annual  incentive  award  under  the  his
Employer's annual incentive plan or the Executive  Incentive  Compensation Plan,
as determined and adjusted by the Plan  Administrator  and to the extent paid in
U.S.  dollars from an Employer's U.S.  payroll.  An eligible  Employee's  annual
incentive   awards  shall  be  adjusted  to  reduce  them  for   applicable  tax
withholdings,  Employee authorized  deductions (including deductions for SaveUp,
Benefits Plus and charitable donations), tax levies, garnishments and such other
amounts as the Plan  Administrator  recognizes  as  reducing  the amount of such
awards available for deferral.

: The person or persons who a Participant properly designates,  as determined by
the  Plan  Administrator,  to  receive  the  amounts  in  one  or  more  of  the
Participant's  subaccounts  in the  event  of  the  Participant's  death.  To be
effective,  any  Beneficiary  designation  must  be in  writing,  signed  by the
Participant,  and filed with the Plan  Administrator  prior to the Participant's
death,  and it must meet such other  standards as the Plan  Administrator  shall
require  from  time to time.  If no  designation  is in  effect at the time of a
Participant's  death or if all designated  Beneficiaries  have  predeceased  the
Participant,   then  the  Participant's  Beneficiary  shall  be  his  estate.  A
Beneficiary  designation  of an  individual  by name (or name and  relationship)
remains  in  effect  regardless  of any  change in the  designated  individual's
relationship  to  the   Participant.   A  Beneficiary   designation   solely  by
relationship  (for example,  a designation  of "spouse,"  that does not give the
name of the spouse) shall designate  whoever is the person in that  relationship
to the  Participant  at his death.  An individual who is otherwise a Beneficiary
with respect to a  Participant's  Account  ceases to be a  Beneficiary  when all
payments have been made from the Account.

:  PepsiCo, Inc., a North Carolina corporation, or its successor or
successors.

: A subaccount of a Participant's  Account maintained to reflect his interest in

losses credited to such subaccount in accordance with Section 4.1(b).

: A Participant who is entitled to receive  benefits under the PepsiCo Long Term
Disability  Plan shall be deemed to suffer from a disability.  Participants  who
are not eligible to participate in the PepsiCo Long Term  Disability  Plan shall
be  deemed  to  suffer to from a  disability  if,  in the  judgment  of the Plan
Administrator,  they satisfy the standards for disability under the PepsiCo Long
Term Disability Plan.

the average of the high and low price on such date for PepsiCo  Capital Stock as
reported  on the  composite  tape for  securities  listed on the New York  Stock
Exchange,  Inc., rounded to four decimal places. For purposes of determining the
value  of a  Plan  distribution  or for  reallocating  amounts  between  phantom
investment  options  under the Plan,  the Fair Market  Value of PepsiCo  Captial
Stock is  determined  as the  closing  price on the  applicable  Valuation  Date
(identified based on the Plan  Administrator's  current  procedures) for PepsiCo
Capital Stock,  whichever is  applicable,  as reported on the composite tape for
securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange,  Inc., rounded to four decimal
places.

:  Any  Employee  eligible  pursuant  to  Section  3.1  who  has  satisfied  the
requirements  for  participation  in  this  Plan  and  who  has  an  Account.  A
Participant  includes  any  individual  who deferred  compensation  prior to the
Effective  Date and for whom any Employer  maintains on its books an Account for
such deferred  compensation as of the Effective  Date. An active  Participant is
one who is currently deferring under Section 3.2.

: The adjusted performance unit award payable to an Employee under the Company's
Long Term Incentive Plan during a Plan Year, to the extent paid in U.S.  dollars

authorized  deductions,  tax levies,  garnishments and such other amounts as the
Plan  Administrator  recognizes as reducing the amount of such awards  available

employment  of the  Company  or  its  affiliates.  A  Participant's  service  is
determined under the terms of the PepsiCo Salaried Employees Retirement Plan.

:  The subaccount provided for by Section 4.3 to contain the portion of each
separate deferral that is subject to forfeiture.

: The gains on an eligible  Employee's  Performance Share Stock Options that are
available for deferral under the Plan pursuant to Section  3.3(c).  With respect
to any options that are made subject to a Stock Option Gain  deferral  election,
the gains on such options shall be determined  through a sale of related  shares
by the Plan  Administrator  net of: (i) the exercise price of the options,  (ii)
any transaction  costs incurred when such gains are captured through the sale of
related  shares,  and  (iii)  any  related  taxes  that the  Plan  Administrator
determines will not otherwise be satisfied by the  Participant.  For purposes of
such sales, the Plan  Administrator  may aggregate shares related to the options
of  different  Participants,  sell them over one or more days and divide the net
proceeds  from such  aggregate  sales between the  Participants  in a reasonable
manner.  The Plan Administrator  shall have absolute  discretion with respect to
the timing and aggregation of such sales.

: A Participant's  cessation of employment  with the Company,  all Employers and

shall apply:

                  (a) A Participant  does not have a  Termination  of Employment
      when the business unit or division of the Company that employs him is sold
      if the Participant and substantially all employees of that entity continue
      to be  employed  by  the  entity  or  its  successor  after  the  sale.  A
      Participant  also  does  not have a  Termination  of  Employment  when the
      subsidiary of the Company that employs him is sold if: (i) the Participant
      continues  to be employed by the entity or its  successor  after the sale,
      and (ii) the Participant's interest in the Plan continues to be carried as
      a  liability  by that  entity or its  successor  after the sale  through a
      successor  arrangement.  In each case,  the  Participant's  Termination of
      Employment  shall occur upon the  Participant's  post-sale  termination of
      employment   from  such  entity  or  its  successor   (and  their  related
      organizations, as determined by the Plan Administrator).

                  (b)  With  respect  to  any  individual  deferral,   the  term
      "Termination of Employment"  may encompass a Participant's  death or death
      may be considered a separate event, depending upon the convention the Plan
      Administrator follows with respect to such deferral.

: Each date as of which  Participant  Accounts  are  valued in  accordance  with

                                   ARTICLE III

                                  PARTICIPATION

 .           3.1  Eligibility to Participate

                  (a) An Employee shall be eligible to defer  compensation under
      the Plan while  employed by an Employer at salary grade level 14 or above.
      Notwithstanding  the  preceding  sentence,  from  time  to time  the  Plan
      Administrator may modify,  limit or expand the class of Employees eligible
      to defer hereunder,  pursuant to criteria for eligibility that need not be
      uniform  among  all or any  group  of  Employees.  During  the  period  an
      individual satisfies all of the eligibility  requirements of this section,
      he shall be referred to as an eligible Employee.

                  (b) Each eligible  Employee  becomes an active  Participant on
      the date an amount is first withheld from his compensation  pursuant to an
      Election Form  submitted by the Employee to the Plan  Administrator  under
      Section 3.3.

                  (c) An  individual's  eligibility to  participate  actively by
      making deferrals under Section 3.2 shall cease upon the earlier of:

                        (1) The date he ceases to be an Employee who is employed
            by an Employer at salary grade level 14 or above; or

                        (2) The date the  Employee  ceases to be eligible  under
            criteria described in the last sentence of subsection (a) above.

                  (d) An individual,  who has been an active  Participant  under
      the Plan, ceases to be a Participant on the date his Account is fully paid
      out.

 .           3.2  Deferral Election

                  (a) Each eligible Employee may make an election to defer under
      the Plan any whole percentage (up to 100%) of his Base Compensation, Bonus
      Compensation,  Performance Unit Payout or Stock Option Gains in the manner
      described in Section 3.3. Any amount of Base  Compensation  deferred by an
      eligible  Employee for a Plan Year will be deducted each pay period during
      the Plan  Year  for  which he has  Base  Compensation  and is an  eligible
      Employee.  The amount of Bonus  Compensation  or  Performance  Unit Payout
      deferred by an Eligible Employee for a Plan Year will be deducted from his
      payment  under the  applicable  compensation  program at the time it would
      otherwise be made,  provided he remains an eligible Employee at such time.
      Any Stock Option Gains deferred by an eligible  Employee shall be captured
      as of the date or dates applicable for the category of underlying  options
      under procedures adopted by the Plan Administrator, provided that the Plan
      Administrator  determines the eligible  Employee's  rights in such options
      may still be recognized at such time.

                  (b) To be effective, an Eligible Employee's Election Form must
      set forth the  percentage  of Base  Compensation,  Bonus  Compensation  or
      Performance  Unit Payout to be deferred (or for a deferral of Stock Option
      Gains,  the specific  options on which any gains are to be deferred),  the
      investment  choice  under  Section 4.1 (in  multiples  of 5 percent),  the
      deferral  period under  Section 3.4, the eligible  Employee's  Beneficiary
      designation,  and any other  information that may be requested by the Plan
      Administrator from time to time. In addition,  the Election Form must meet
      the requirements of Section 3.3 below.

 .           3.3  Time and Manner of Deferral Election
                 ------------------------------------

                  (a)  Deferrals of Base  Compensation.  Subject to the next two
      sentences,  an eligible  Employee must make a deferral election for a Plan
      Year with  respect to Base  Compensation  at least two months prior to the
      Plan Year in which  the Base  Compensation  would  otherwise  be paid.  An
      individual who newly becomes an eligible  Employee  during a Plan Year (or
      less than three months prior to a Plan Year) may make a deferral  election
      with  respect to Base  Compensation  to be paid  during the balance of the
      current  Plan Year  within 30 days of the date the  individual  becomes an
      eligible  Employee.  Such an individual  may also make an election at this
      time with  respect to Base  Compensation  to be paid  during the next Plan
      Year.

                  (b) Deferrals of Bonuses and Performance Unit Payouts. Subject
      to the next sentence,  an eligible  Employee must make a deferral election
      for a Plan Year with respect to his Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit
      Payout  at least  six  months  prior to the Plan  Year in which  the Bonus
      Compensation  or  Performance  Unit Payout  would  otherwise  be paid.  An
      individual  who newly  becomes an  eligible  Employee  may make a deferral
      election with respect to his Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit Payout
      to be paid  during  the  succeeding  Plan  Year  so  long as the  deferral
      election  is made  within 30 days of the date the  individual  becomes  an
      eligible Employee and prior to the first day of such succeeding Plan Year.

                  (c)  Deferrals of Stock Option Gains.  From time to time,  the
      Plan  Administrator  shall  notify  eligible  Employees  with  outstanding
      Performance Share Options which options then qualify for deferral of their
      related  Stock  Option  Gains.  An eligible  Employee  who has  qualifying
      options must make a deferral  election  with respect to his related  Stock
      Option Gains at least 6 months before such  qualifying  options'  proposed
      capture  date (as defined  below) or, if  earlier,  in the  calendar  year
      preceding  the year of the proposed  capture date.  The "proposed  capture
      date"  for a set of  options  shall  be the  earliest  date  that the Plan
      Administrator   would  capture  a  Participant's  Stock  Option  Gains  in
      accordance  with the deferral  agreement  prepared for such purpose by the
      Plan Administrator.

                  (d) General  Provisions.  A separate  deferral  election under
      (a),  (b) or (c)  above  must be made by an  eligible  Employee  for  each
      category of a Plan Year's  compensation that is eligible for deferral.  If
      an  eligible  Employee  fails to file a properly  completed  and  executed
      Election Form with the Plan  Administrator by the prescribed time, he will
      be  deemed  to have  elected  not to defer  any Base  Compensation,  Bonus
      Compensation,  Performance  Unit Payout or Stock Option Gains, as the case
      may be, for the  applicable  Plan Year.  An election is  irrevocable  once
      received  and  determined  by  the  Plan   Administrator  to  be  properly
      completed.   Increases  or  decreases  in  the  amount  or   percentage  a
      Participant  elects to defer  shall not be  permitted  during a Plan Year.
      Notwithstanding  the preceding three  sentences,  to the extent  necessary
      because of extraordinary  circumstances,  the Plan Administrator may grant
      an  extension  of any  election  period  and may  permit  (to  the  extent
      necessary to avoid undue  hardship to an eligible  Employee)  the complete
      revocation  of an  election  with  respect to future  deferrals.  Any such
      extension or revocation shall be available only if the Plan  Administrator
      determines that it shall not trigger constructive receipt of income and is
      desirable for plan administration, and only upon such conditions as may be
      required by the Plan Administrator.

                  (e)  Beneficiaries.  A Participant  designates on the Election
      Form a Beneficiary to receive payment in the event of his death of amounts
      credited to his Account.  A  Beneficiary  is paid in  accordance  with the
      terms  of a  Participant's  Election  Form,  as  interpreted  by the  Plan
      Administrator  in  accordance  with the terms of this Plan. At any time, a
      Participant   may  change  a  Beneficiary   designation  for  any  or  all
      subaccounts in a writing that is signed by the  Participant and filed with
      the Plan  Administrator  prior to the Participant's  death, and that meets
      such other standards as the Plan Administrator  shall require from time to
      time.

            3.4  Period of  Deferral.  An  eligible  Employee  making a deferral
election  shall specify a deferral  period on his Election Form by designating a
specific  payout date, one or more specific payout events or both a date and one
or more specific events from the choices that are made available to the eligible
Employee by the Plan  Administrator.  Subject to the next sentence,  an eligible
Employee's  elected  period of deferral  shall run until the earliest  occurring
date or event  specified  on his  Election  Form.  Notwithstanding  an  eligible
Employee's actual election, an eligible Employee shall be deemed to have elected
a period of deferral of not less than:

                  (a) For Base  Compensation,  at least 6 months  after the Plan
      Year during  which the Base  Compensation  would have been paid absent the
      deferral;

                  (b) For Bonus Compensation, at least 1 year after the date the
      Bonus Compensation would have been paid absent the deferral;

                  (c) For  Performance  Unit Payouts,  at least 1 year after the
      date the Performance Unit Payout would have been paid absent the deferral;
      and

                  (d) For Stock Option Gains, at least 1 year after the date the
      Stock Option Gain is credited to a Deferral  Subaccount for the benefit of
      the Participant.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                            INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS

 .           4.1  Accounting for Participants' Interests

                  (a)  Deferral  Subaccounts.  Each  Participant  shall  have  a
      separate  Deferral  Subaccount  credited  with the amount of each separate
      deferral of Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation, Performance Unit Payout
      or  Stock  Option  Gains  made  by the  Participant  under  this  Plan.  A
      Participant's  deferral  shall  be  credited  to his  Account  as  soon as
      practicable  following the date when the deferral of compensation actually
      occurs, as determined by the Plan Administrator.  A Participant's  Account
      is a  bookkeeping  device  to track the  value of his  deferrals  (and his
      Employer's liability therefor).  No assets shall be reserved or segregated
      in  connection  with any  Account,  and no  Account  shall be  insured  or
      otherwise secured.

                  (b) Account  Earnings or Losses.  As of each Valuation Date, a
      Participant's Account shall be credited with earnings and gains (and shall
      be debited for expenses and losses)  determined as if the amounts credited
      to his Account had actually been  invested as directed by the  Participant
      in  accordance  with this section (as modified by Section  4.3).  The Plan
      provides  only for "phantom  investments,"  and therefore  such  earnings,
      gains, expenses and losses are hypothetical and not actual.  However, they
      shall be applied to measure the value of a  Participant's  Account and the
      amount of his  Employer's  liability  to make  deferred  payments to or on
      behalf of the Participant.

                        (c)  Investment   Options.   Each  of  a   Participant's
      Subaccounts  (other than those  containing  Stock  Option  Gains) shall be
      invested  on a phantom  basis in any  combination  of  phantom  investment
      options  specified by the  Participant  (or  following  the  Participant's
      death, by his  Beneficiary)  from those offered by the Plan  Administrator
      from time to time.  Subsection  (e) below  governs the phantom  investment
      options   available  for  deferrals  of  Stock  Option  Gains.   The  Plan
      Administrator  may discontinue any phantom  investment option with respect
      to some or all Accounts,  and it may provide for shifting a  Participant's
      phantom investment from the discontinued option to a specified replacement
      option  (unless the  Participant  selects  another  replacement  option in
      accordance with such requirements as the Plan Administrator may apply). As
      of the Effective Date, the phantom investment options are:

                              (1) Interest Bearing Account. Participant Accounts
            invested in this phantom option accrue a return based upon the prime
            rate of interest  announced from time to time by Citibank,  N.A. (or
            another  bank  designated  by the Plan  Administrator  from  time to
            time).  Returns  accrue  during the period since the last  Valuation
            Date  based on the prime  rate in effect on the first  business  day
            after such  Valuation Date and are  compounded  annually.  An amount
            deferred  or  transferred  into  this  option is  credited  with the
            applicable  rate of return  beginning  with the date as of which the
            amount is invested in this option by the Plan Administrator.

                              (2) PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  Account.  Participant
            Accounts  invested in this phantom option are adjusted to reflect an
            investment  in  PepsiCo   Capital  Stock.   An  amount  deferred  or
            transferred  into this  option is  converted  to  phantom  shares of
            PepsiCo Capital Stock of equivalent value by dividing such amount by
            the Fair  Market  Value of a share of PepsiCo  Capital  Stock on the
            date as of which the amount is  invested  in this option by the Plan
            Administrator.  Only whole  shares  are  determined.  Any  remaining
            amount  (and all  amounts  that would be  received by the Account as
            dividends,  if  dividends  were paid on  phantom  shares of  PepsiCo
            Capital  Stock as they  are on  actual  shares)  are  credited  to a
            dividend  subaccount  that is  invested  in the  phantom  option  in
            paragraph (1) above (the Interest Bearing Account).

                                    (i) A Participant's  interest in the PepsiCo
                  Capital  Stock  Account  is valued as of a  Valuation  Date by
                  multiplying  the  number of  phantom  shares  credited  to his
                  Account  on such date by the Fair  Market  Value of a share of
                  PepsiCo  Capital Stock on such date, and then adding the value
                  of the Participant's dividend subaccount.

                                    (ii) If  shares  of  PepsiCo  Capital  Stock
                  change  by  reason  of  any  stock  split,   stock   dividend,
                  recapitalization,  merger, consolidation, spinoff, combination
                  or exchange of shares or other similar corporate change,  such
                  equitable  adjustment  shall be made in the  number  of shares
                  credited to an Account or subaccount as the Plan Administrator
                  may determine to be necessary or appropriate.

            In no event  will  shares  of  PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  actually  be
            purchased or held under this Plan, and no Participant shall have any
            rights as a  shareholder  of PepsiCo  Capital Stock on account of an
            interest in this phantom option.

                              (3) SaveUp  Accounts.  From time to time, the Plan
            Administrator  shall designate which of the investment options under
            the Company's  Long Term Savings Plan (SaveUp) shall be available as
            phantom  investment  options  under this Plan.  As of the  Effective
            Date, such available  phantom options are the Equity-Index  Account,
            Equity-Income  Account,  and the Security Plus Account.  Participant
            Accounts  invested in these phantom  options are adjusted to reflect
            an investment in the corresponding  investment options under SaveUp.
            An amount  deferred  or  transferred  into one of these  options  is
            converted  to  phantom  units  in  the  applicable  SaveUp  fund  of
            equivalent  value by dividing  such amount by the value of a unit in
            such fund on the date as of which the  amount  is  invested  in this
            option  by  the  Plan  Administrator.  Thereafter,  a  Participant's
            interest  in each such  phantom  option is valued as of a  Valuation
            Date by  multiplying  the number of phantom  units  credited  to his
            Account on such date by the value of a unit in the applicable SaveUp
            fund.

                  (d)  Method  of  Allocation.  With  respect  to  any  deferral
      election by a Participant,  the Participant  must use his Election Form to
      allocate the deferral in 5 percent increments among the phantom investment
      options then offered by the Plan Administrator.  Thereafter, a Participant
      may  reallocate  previously  deferred  amounts in a subaccount by properly
      completing  and  submitting  a fund  transfer  form  provided  by the Plan
      Administrator and specifying, in 5 percent increments, the reallocation of
      his Subaccount  among the phantom  investment  options then offered by the
      Plan  Administrator.  Any such  transfer form shall be effective as of the
      Valuation  Date that  follows  its  receipt by at least the number of days
      that the Plan Administrator  specifies for this purpose from time to time.
      If more  than  one  transfer  form is  received  on a timely  basis  for a
      subaccount, the transfer form that the Plan Administrator determines to be
      the most recent shall be followed.

                  (e)  Investment  Choices for Stock Option Gains.  Deferrals of
      Stock Option gains  initially may be invested only in the PepsiCo  Capital
      Stock  Account.  In  the  case  of a  Participant  who  has  attained  his
      Retirement,  the Plan  Administrator may make available some or all of the
      other phantom  investment  options  described in subsection (c) above.  In
      this case,  any election to  reallocate  the balance in the  Participant's
      applicable   Deferral  Subaccount  shall  be  governed  by  the  foregoing
      provisions of this section.

 . Except as provided in Section  4.3, a  Participant's  interest in the value of
his Account shall at all times be 100 percent percent  vested,  which means that
it will not forfeit as a result of his Termination of Employment.

            4.3 Risk of Forfeiture Subaccounts. A Participant may elect to defer
Base  Compensation,  Bonus Compensation or Performance Unit Payouts to a Risk of
Forfeiture  Subaccount  only if:  (i) he had,  as of June 1,  1994,  a  deferred
compensation  subaccount  maintained  under a forfeiture  agreement  (as defined
below),  and (ii) he is not yet  eligible for  Retirement  when the first amount
would  be  deferred  pursuant  to his  current  risk-of-forfeiture  election.  A
"forfeiture agreement" is an agreement with the Company, any Employer, or one of
their  predecessors  providing  that the  subaccount  would be  forfeited if the
employee terminated employment  voluntarily or on account of misconduct prior to
Retirement..  A Participant who meets these requirements may elect under Article
III to defer some or all of his eligible  compensation  to a Risk of  Forfeiture
Subaccount subject to the following terms.

                  (a) A Risk of Forfeiture  Subaccount  will be  terminated  and
      forfeited  in  the  event  that  the  Participant  has  a  Termination  of
      Employment  that is  voluntary or because of his  misconduct  prior to the
      earliest of:

                        (1)  The end of the deferral period designated in his
            Election Form for such deferral;

                        (2)  The  date  the  Participant  becomes  eligible  for
            Retirement (as specified above); or

                        (3) The date  indicated on his Election  Form as the end
            of the risk of forfeiture  condition (but not before  completing the
            minimum risk of forfeiture period required by the Plan Administrator
            from time to time).

                  (b) A Risk of Forfeiture  Subaccount shall become fully vested
      (and shall cease to be a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount) when:

                        (1)  The  Participant   reaches  any  of  the  dates  in
            subsection  (a) above while still  employed by the Company or one of
            its affiliates, or

                        (2) On the date the Participant terminates involuntarily
            from his Employer  (including death and termination for Disability),
            provided that such termination is not for his misconduct.

                  (c) No amounts credited to a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount may
      be  transferred to a subaccount of the  Participant  that is not a Risk of
      Forfeiture  Subaccount.  No  amounts  credited  to  a  subaccount  of  the
      Participant that is not a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount may be transferred
      to a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount.

                  (d) A Participant may initially direct and then reallocate his
      Risk of  Forfeiture  Subaccount to any of the phantom  investment  options
      under  the Plan  that  are  currently  available  for  such  direction  or
      reallocation,  whichever  applies.  During  the  period  before  a Risk of
      Forfeiture  Subaccount ceases to be a Risk of Forfeiture  Subaccount,  the
      return under any such phantom  investment  option shall be supplemented as
      follows.

                        (1) In the case of the PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  Account,
            the Participant's  dividend subaccount  thereunder shall be credited
            with an additional  year-end  dividend  amount equal to 2 percent of
            the  average  closing  price of  PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  for the 30
            business  days  preceding  the  end of  the  Company's  fiscal  year
            multiplied by the number of phantom shares of PepsiCo  Capital Stock
            credited to the Participant's  Account as of the end of the year. If
            the Participant's subaccount was not a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount
            for the entire year (or if the  Participant  reallocated  amounts to
            the PepsiCo  Capital Stock Account after the beginning of the year),
            this  2  percent   additional   dividend   will  be  prorated   down
            appropriately, as determined by the Plan Administrator. In addition,
            the Participant's  dividend subaccount shall earn interest at a rate
            that is 2 percent  above the rate  ordinarily  applicable  under the
            Interest  Bearing Account for the period that it is contained within
            a Risk of Forfeiture Subaccount.

                        (2)  In  the  case  of  any  other   available   phantom
            investment   option,  the  return  on  each  such  option  shall  be
            supplemented with an additional 2% annual return for the period that
            it is held within a Risk of Forfeiture  Subaccount (but prorated for
            periods of such investment of less than a year).

 .  A Participant's Account shall be distributed in cash as provided in this
Section 4.4.

                  (a)  Scheduled Payout Date.  With respect to a specific
      deferral, a Participant's "Scheduled Payout Date" shall be the earlier
      of:

                        (1)  The  date  selected  by the  Participant  for  such
            deferral in accordance with Section 3.4, or

                        (2) The first day of the  calendar  quarter that follows
            the  earliest to occur event  selected by the  Participant  for such
            deferral in accordance with Section 3.4.

      Notwithstanding  the prior  sentence,  in the case of a deferral  of Stock
      Option  Gains,  a  Participant's  Scheduled  Payout Date for such deferral
      shall be first day of the calendar  quater  following his  Termination  of
      Employment  other than for death,  Disability or Retirement  (or 12 months
      after the date of the  deferral,  if that  would be later  than such first
      day).  Unless an election has been made in accordance  with subsection (b)
      below,  the  Participant's  subaccount  containing  the deferral  shall be
      distributed to the Participant in a single lump sum as soon as practicable
      following the Scheduled Payout Date.

                  (b) Payment  Election.  A  Participant  may delay receipt of a
      subaccount   beyond  its  Scheduled  Payout  Date,  or  elect  to  receive
      installments  rather than a lump sum, by making a payment  election  under
      this  subsection.  A payment  election  must be made by the calendar  year
      before the year  containing the Scheduled  Payout Date (or if earlier,  at
      least 6 months before the Scheduled  Payout Date). Any payment election to
      receive a lump sum at a later time must specify a revised payout date that
      is at least 12  months  after  the  Scheduled  Payout  Date.  Any  payment
      election  to  receive  installment  payments  in lieu of a lump sum  shall
      specify the amount (or method for determining)  each installment and a set
      of  revised  payout  dates,  the last of which  must be at least 12 months
      after the Scheduled Payout Date. With respect to any subaccount,  only one
      election  may  be  made  under  this  subsection.  Beneficiaries  are  not
      permitted  to make  elections  under  this  subsection.  In  addition,  an
      election  under  this  subsection  may not  delay  the  distribution  of a
      deferral of Stock Option Gains made by a Participant  whose employment has
      terminated other than for death, Disability or Retirement. Actual payments
      shall be made as soon as practicable following a revised payout date.

                  (c)  Valuation.  In  determining  the amount of any individual
      distribution  pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) above,  the  Participant's
      subaccount  shall  continue to be credited  with  earnings  and gains (and
      debited for  expenses  and losses)  under  Sections  4.1 and 4.3 until the
      Valuation Date preceding the Scheduled  Payout Date or revised payout date
      for such distribution (whichever is applicable).  In determining the value
      of  a  Participant's   remaining   subaccount   following  an  installment
      distribution,  such installment distribution shall reduce the value of the
      Participant's  subaccount as of the close of the Valuation  Date preceding
      the revised payout date for such installment.

                  (d)   Limitations.   The   following   limitations   apply  to
      distributions from the Plan.

                        (1)   Installments   may   only   be   made   quarterly,
            semi-annually  or  annually,  for a period of no more than 20 years,
            and not later than the  Participant's  80th  birthday (or what would
            have been his 80th birthday, if the Participant dies earlier).

                        (2) If a Participant has elected a Scheduled Payout Date
            that  would be after his 80th  birthday,  the  Participant  shall be
            deemed to have  elected his 80th  birthday as his  Scheduled  Payout
            Date.

                        (3) If a Participant has elected to defer income,  which
            would qualify as  performance-based  compensation under Code section
            162(m), into a Risk of Forfeiture  Subaccount,  then such subaccount
            may not be paid out at any time while the  Participant  is a covered
            employee  under  Code  section  162(m)(3),  to the  extent  the Plan
            Administrator  determines it would result in compensation being paid
            to the  Participant in such year that would not be deductible  under
            Code section 162(m). The payout of any such amount shall be deferred
            until a year when the  Participant  is no  longer a  section  162(m)
            covered  employee.  The Plan  Administrator  may waive the foregoing
            provisions  of this  paragraph  to the extent  necessary to avoid an
            undue  hardship  to the  Participant.  This  paragraph  shall  apply
            notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary.

                  (e) Upon a Participant's  death, his Beneficiary shall be paid
      each subaccount still standing to the Participant's  credit under the Plan
      in accordance with the terms of the Participant's payout election for such
      subaccount under Section 3.4, or his payment election under subsection (b)
      above, whichever is applicable.

  Except as expressly  provided in this  Section 4.5, no payments  shall be made
under this Plan prior to the date (or dates) applicable under Section 4.4.

                  (a) A Participant who is suffering severe  financial  hardship
      resulting from  extraordinary and unforeseeable  events beyond the control
      of the Participant (and who does not have other funds reasonably available
      that could  satisfy  the  severe  financial  hardship)  may file a written
      request with the Plan  Administrator  for accelerated  payment of all or a
      portion of the amount  credited to his  Account.  A committee  composed of
      representatives from the Company's Compensation Department, Tax Department
      and Law Department,  or such other parties as the Plan  Administrator  may
      specify from time to time, shall have sole discretion to determine whether
      a Participant  satisfies the  requirements  for a hardship request and the
      amount  that  may be  distributed  (which  shall  not  exceed  the  amount
      reasonably necessary to alleviate the Participant's hardship).

                  (b) After a Participant has filed a written  request  pursuant
      to this section,  along with all supporting material,  the committee shall
      grant or deny the request  within 60 days (or such other number of days as
      is  customarily  applied from time to time) unless  special  circumstances
      warrant additional time.

                  (c) The  Plan  Administrator  may  adjust  the  standards  for
      hardship  withdrawals  from time to time to the extent it determines  such
      adjustment  to be necessary to avoid  triggering  constructive  receipt of
      income under the Plan.

                  (d) A  Beneficiary  may also  request a hardship  distribution
      upon  satisfaction  of  the  foregoing  requirements  and  subject  to the
      foregoing limitations.

                  (e)  When  some  or  all  of  a  Participant's  subaccount  is
      distributed  pursuant to this section, the distribution and the subaccount
      shall be  valued  as  provided  by the  Plan  Administrator,  using  rules
      patterned  after those in Section  4.4(c)  above,  on the  Valuation  Date
      coincident  with or  immediately  preceding the date on which approval for
      accelerated payment is granted.


                                    ARTICLE V

                               PLAN ADMINISTRATOR

 . The Plan Administrator is the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of
Directors (the  "Committee") or its delegate or delegates,  who shall act within
the scope of their  delegation  pursuant  to such  operating  guidelines  as the
Committee  shall  establish  from  time  to  time.  The  Plan  Administrator  is
responsible for the administration of the Plan.

 . Action by the Committee may be taken in accordance  with  procedures  that the
Committee  adopts  from  time  to  time or that  the  Company's  Law  Department
determines are legally permissible.

 . The Plan Administrator shall administer and manage the Plan and shall have all
powers necessary to accomplish that purpose,  including (but not limited to) the
following:

                  (a)  To exercise its discretionary authority to construe,
      interpret, and administer this Plan;

                  (b) To  exercise  its  discretionary  authority  to  make  all
      decisions  regarding  eligibility,  participation  and deferrals,  to make
      allocations  and  determinations  required  by this Plan,  and to maintain
      records regarding Participants' Accounts;

                  (c) To  compute  and  certify to the  Employer  the amount and
      kinds of payments to Participants or their Beneficiaries, and to determine
      the time and manner in which such payments are to be paid;

                  (d) To authorize all disbursements by the Employer pursuant to
      this Plan;

                  (e) To maintain (or cause to be maintained)  all the necessary
      records for administration of this Plan;

                  (f) To make and publish such rules for the  regulation of this
      Plan as are not inconsistent with the terms hereof;

                  (g) To delegate to other  individuals or entities from time to
      time the performance of any of its duties or responsibilities hereunder;

                  (h) To establish or to change the phantom  investment  options
      or arrangements under Article IV; and

                  (i) To hire agents,  accountants,  actuaries,  consultants and
      legal counsel to assist in operating and administering the Plan.

The Plan Administrator has the exclusive and discretionary authority to construe
and to interpret the Plan, to decide all questions of eligibility  for benefits,
to determine  the amount and manner of payment of such  benefits and to make any
determinations that are contemplated by (or permissible under) the terms of this
Plan,  and its  decisions on such matters  will be final and  conclusive  on all
parties.  Any such decision or  determination  shall be made in the absolute and
unrestricted  discretion of the Plan Administrator,  even if (A) such discretion
is  not  expressly  granted  by  the  Plan  provisions  in  question,  or  (B) a
determination  is not expressly  called for by the Plan  provisions in question,
and even though other Plan provisions  expressly grant  discretion or call for a
determination.  In the  event of a review  by a court,  arbitrator  or any other
tribunal, any exercise of the Plan Administrator's discretionary authority shall
not be disturbed unless it is clearly shown to be arbitrary and capricious.

 . The Plan  Administrator  will serve without bond and without  compensation for
services hereunder.  All expenses of the Plan and the Plan Administrator will be
paid by the Employer.  No member of the Committee,  and no individual  acting as
the  delegate of the  Committee,  shall be liable for any act or omission of any
other  member  or  individual,  nor  for any act or  omission  on his own  part,
excepting  his own willful  misconduct.  The Employer  will  indemnify  and hold
harmless each member of the Committee and any individual or  individuals  acting
as the delegate of the Committee  against any and all expenses and  liabilities,
including  reasonable legal fees and expenses,  arising out of his membership on
the Committee (or his serving as the delegate of the Committee),  excepting only
expenses and liabilities arising out of his own willful misconduct.

 . If the whole or any part of any  Participant's  Account becomes liable for the
payment of any estate, inheritance,  income, or other tax which the Employer may
be  required  to pay or  withhold,  the  Employer  will have the full  power and
authority  to withhold  and pay such tax out of any moneys or other  property in
its hand for the  account of the  Participant.  The  Employer  will  provide the
Participant  notice  of such  withholding.  Prior to  making  any  payment,  the
Employer may require such  releases or other  documents  from any lawful  taxing
authority as it shall deem necessary.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                                CLAIMS PROCEDURE

 . If a  Participant  or  Beneficiary  (hereafter,  "Claimant")  does not receive
timely  payment of any benefits  which he believes are due and payable under the
Plan, he may make a claim for benefits to the Plan Administrator.  The claim for
benefits  must be in writing and addressed to the Plan  Administrator  or to the
Company. If the claim for benefits is denied, the Plan Administrator will notify
the Claimant in writing  within 90 days after the Plan  Administrator  initially
received  the  benefit  claim.  However,  if  special  circumstances  require an
extension of time for processing the claim, the Plan  Administrator will furnish
notice of the extension to the Claimant prior to the  termination of the initial
90-day  period and such  extension  may not exceed one  additional,  consecutive
90-day period.  Any notice of a denial of benefits should advise the Claimant of
the basis for the denial, any additional  material or information  necessary for
the Claimant to perfect his claim, and the steps which the Claimant must take to
have his claim for benefits reviewed.

 . Each  Claimant  whose  claim for  benefits  has been denied may file a written
request  for a review of his claim by the Plan  Administrator.  The  request for
review  must be filed by the  Claimant  within  60 days  after he  received  the
written notice denying his claim. The decision of the Plan Administrator will be
made  within  60  days  after  receipt  of a  request  for  review  and  will be
communicated in writing to the Claimant. Such written notice shall set forth the
basis for the Plan Administrator's  decision. If there are special circumstances
which  require  an  extension  of time  for  completing  the  review,  the  Plan
Administrator's  decision may be rendered not later than 120 days after  receipt
of a request for review.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

 . The  Compensation  Committee  of the Board of Directors of the Company has the
right in its sole  discretion to amend this Plan in whole or in part at any time
and in any manner;  provided,  however,  that no such amendment shall reduce the
amount  credited to the Account of any Participant as of the date such amendment
is adopted. Any amendment shall be in writing and adopted by the Committee or an
officer of the Company who is authorized by the Committee for this purpose.  All
Participants shall be bound by such amendment.

 . The Company  expects to continue this Plan, but does not obligate itself to do
so. The Company, acting by the Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors,
reserves the right to  discontinue  and terminate the Plan at any time, in whole
or in part, for any reason  (including a change,  or an impending change, in the
tax laws of the United  States or any  State).  Termination  of the Plan will be
binding on all Participants (and a partial termination shall be binding upon all
affected Participants),  but in no event may such termination reduce the amounts
credited at that time to any Participant's  Account.  If this Plan is terminated
(in whole or in part),  amounts theretofore  credited to affected  Participants'
Accounts may either be paid in a lump sum  immediately,  or  distributed in some
other manner consistent with this Plan, as determined by the Plan  Administrator
in its sole discretion.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS


 .  Participation  in this  Plan  does not give any  Participant  the right to be
retained in the Employer's or Company's employ (or any right or interest in this
Plan or any assets of the  Company or Employer  other than as herein  provided).
The Company and Employer  reserve the right to terminate  the  employment of any
Participant  without any liability for any claim against the Company or Employer
under this Plan, except for a claim for payment of deferrals as provided herein.

 . The benefits  provided by this Plan are  unfunded.  All amounts  payable under
this Plan to Participants are paid from the general assets of the  Participant's
individual  Employer.  Nothing  contained  in this Plan  requires the Company or
Employer  to set aside or hold in trust any amounts or assets for the purpose of
paying benefits to Participants. This Plan creates only a contractual obligation
on the part of a Participant's  individual Employer, and the Participant has the
status of a general unsecured  creditor of this Employer with respect to amounts
of compensation deferred hereunder.  No other Employer guarantees or shares such
obligation, and no other Employer shall have any liability to the Participant or
his  Beneficiary.  In the event, a Participant  transfers from the employment of
one Employer to another,  the former  Employer  shall transfer the liability for
deferrals  made while the  Participant  was employed by that Employer to the new
Employer (and the books of both Employers shall be adjusted appropriately).

 . This Plan shall not affect the right of any eligible  Employee or  Participant
to  participate  in and  receive  benefits  under  and in  accordance  with  the
provisions  of any other  employee  benefit  plans  which  are now or  hereafter
maintained by any Employer, unless the terms of such other employee benefit plan
or plans  specifically  provide  otherwise  or it would cause such other plan to
violate a requirement for tax favored treatment.

 . Any payment to a Participant  in accordance  with the  provisions of this Plan
shall, to the extent thereof,  be in full satisfaction of all claims against the
Plan Administrator, the Employer and the Company, and the Plan Administrator may
require such Participant, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a
receipt and release to such effect.

 . This Plan shall be  construed,  administered,  and governed in all respects in
accordance  with  applicable  federal  law and, to the extent not  preempted  by
federal law, in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina.  If any
provisions of this instrument shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid or unenforceable,  the remaining  provisions hereof shall continue
to be fully effective.

 . The Plan  Administrator  may select any corporation  related to the Company by
stock ownership as an Employer and permit or cause such corporation to adopt the
Plan. The selection by the Plan Administrator shall govern the effective date of
the adoption of the Plan by such related Employer.

 . In this Plan, whenever the context so indicates, the singular or plural number
and the  masculine,  feminine,  or neuter  gender shall be deemed to include the
other.  Headings and  subheadings  in this Plan are inserted for  convenience of
reference  only and are not  considered in the  construction  of the  provisions
hereof.

 . This Plan inures to the benefit of and is binding upon the parties  hereto and
their  successors,  heirs  and  assigns;  provided,  however,  that the  amounts
credited to the Account of a Participant  are not (except as provided in Section
5.5)  subject  in  any  manner  to  anticipation,  alienation,  sale,  transfer,
assignment, pledge, encumbrance,  charge, garnishment,  execution or levy of any
kind, either voluntary or involuntary, and any attempt to anticipate,  alienate,
sell, transfer,  assign,  pledge,  encumber,  charge or otherwise dispose of any
right to any benefits payable  hereunder,  including,  without  limitation,  any
assignment or alienation in connection with a separation, divorce, child support
or similar arrangement, will be null and void and not binding on the Plan or the
Company or Employer.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the Company  reserves the
right to make payments in accordance  with a divorce  decree,  judgment or other
court order as and when cash payments are made in  accordance  with the terms of
this Plan due to the Account of a Participant and credited against such Account.

 . Whenever,  in the Plan  Administrator's  opinion, a Participant or Beneficiary
entitled to receive  any payment  hereunder  is under a legal  disability  or is
incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the
Plan Administrator may direct the Employer to make payments to such person or to
the legal representative of such person for his benefit, or to apply the payment
for the  benefit  of  such  person  in such  manner  as the  Plan  Administrator
considers  advisable.  Any payment in  accordance  with the  provisions  of this
section  shall be a complete  discharge of any  liability for the making of such
payment to the Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan.

 . This Plan document  encompasses three separate plans of deferred  compensation
for all legal  purposes,  including  ERISA and federal and state tax law, as set
forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c) below.

                  (a) The portion of the Plan that  provides  for  deferrals  of
      Base  Compensation  and Bonus  Compensation  (which  shall be known as the
      "PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Plan").

                  (b) The portion of the Plan that  provides  for  deferrals  of
      Performance Unit Payouts (which shall be known as the "PepsiCo Performance
      Unit Deferral Plan").

                  (c) The portion of the Plan that  provides  for  deferrals  of
      Stock Option  Gains  (which  shall be known as the  "PepsiCo  Option Gains
      Deferral Plan").

Together, these three separate plans of deferred compensation are referred to as
the PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program.



      This _____ day of  ____________________,  1997, the above restated Plan is
hereby  adopted and  approved by the  Company's  duly  authorized  officer to be
effective as stated herein.

                                    ARTICLE A

                                SPINOFF OF TRICON

            This Article sets forth provisions that apply in connection with the
Company's spinoff of Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc.

            A.1 Definitions: When used in this Article, the following underlined
terms shall have the meanings set forth below.  Except as otherwise  provided in
this  Article,  all terms that are  defined in Article II of the Plan shall have
the meaning assigned to them by Article II.

                  (a) Distribution Date: The "Distribution Date" as that term is
      defined in the 1997 Separation Agreement between PepsiCo, Inc.
      and Tricon.

                  (b) PepsiCo Account Holder:  A Participant who has an interest
      in the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account on the Reference Date.

                  (c)   Reference   Date:   The  date   specified  by  the  Plan
      Administrator  for purposes of  determining  who shall be credited with an
      interest in the Tricon Common Stock Account.

                  (d)  Transferred Individual:  A "Transferred Individual" as
      that term is defined in the 1997 Employee Programs Agreement between
      PepsiCo, Inc. and Tricon.

                  (e)  Transition Individuals:  A "Transition Individual" as
      that term is defined in the 1997 Employee Programs Agreement between
      PepsiCo, Inc. and Tricon.

                  (f) Tricon: Tricon Global Restaurants,  Inc., a North Carolina
      Corporation.

                  (g) Tricon  Account  Holder:  A PepsiCo  Account  Holder whose
      interest  in the  PepsiCo  Capital  Stock  Account on the  Reference  Date
      includes at least 10 phantom shares of PepsiCo Capital Stock.

            A.2 Transfer of Benefits and Liabilities. Effective as of the end of
the day on the  Distribution  Date,  all  interests  in the  Plan  of (and  Plan
liabilities  with respect to)  nonterminated  Transferred  Individuals  shall be
transferred to the Tricon Executive Income Deferral Program. This transfer shall
constitute  a complete  payout of these  individuals'  Accounts  for purposes of
determining  who is a  Participant  or  Beneficiary  under  the  Plan.  For this
purpose, a Transferred  Individual shall be considered  "nonterminated" if he is
actively  employed by (or on a leave of absence  from and expected to return to)
Tricon and any of its affiliates,  as of the end of the day on the  Distribution
Date.

            A.3 Cessation of Employer Status. Effective as of the end of the day
on the  Distribution  Date, any Employer who is a member of the Tricon corporate
group (Tricon and its affiliates, as determined by the Plan Administrator) shall
no longer  qualify as  Employers  hereunder.  Any  individual  whose  Account is
transferred in accordance with Section A.2 shall not thereafter be able to defer
any  compensation  (including  Stock Option  Gains)  under this Plan,  unless he
returns to employment with an Employer following the Distribution Date.

            A.4 Employment Transfers by Transition Individuals. If a Participant
is transferred to Tricon under  circumstances  that cause him to be a Transition
Individual  (a  "Transition  Transfer"),  such  transfer to Tricon  shall not be
considered  a  Termination  of  Employment  or other  event that  could  trigger
distribution  of the  Participant's  interest  in the Plan.  In this  case,  the
Participant's interest in the Plan (and all Plan liabilities with respect to the
Participant)  shall be  transferred  to the  Tricon  Executive  Income  Deferral
Program.  This transfer shall constitute a complete payout of the  Participant's
Account for purposes of determining  who is a Participant  or Beneficiary  under
the Plan.

            A.5 Special Tricon Stock Investment  Option.  As of the Distribution
Date, the Plan  Administrator  shall  establish a temporary  phantom  investment
option under the Plan, the Tricon Common Stock Account,  and each Tricon Account
Holder shall be credited with an interest in such account.

                  (a) Establishing the Account Holder's Interest.  The amount of
      a Tricon  Account  Holder's  interest is  determined by dividing by 10 the
      number of phantom  shares of PepsiCo  Capital Stock standing to his credit
      in the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account on the Reference Date. The portion of
      the  resulting  quotient that is an integer shall be the number of phantom
      shares of Tricon Common Stock that is credited to the Participant's Tricon
      Common Stock Account as of the Distribution  Date. A Tricon Stock Holder's
      interest in the Tricon  Common Stock Account shall also include a dividend
      subaccount.  The initial balance in the divident subaccount shall be zero,
      but it shall  thereafter  be  credited  with  all  amounts  that  would be
      received  for the  Participant  by the  Tricon  Common  Stock  Account  as
      dividends, if dividends were paid on phantom shares of Tricon Common Stock
      as they are on  actual  shares.  All  amounts  credited  to this  dividend
      subaccount  shall be invested in the phantom  option  described in Section
      4.1(c)(1) (the Interest Bearing Account).

                  (b) Valuation and Adjustment:  A Participant's interest in the
      Tricon  Common  Stock  Account  is  valued  as  of  a  Valuation  Date  by
      multiplying  the number of phantom shares  credited to his Account on such
      date by the fair market  value of a share of Tricon  Common  Stock on such
      date, and then adding the value of the Participant's dividend subaccount.

                        (1) As of any  date,  the fair  market  value of  Tricon
            Common Stock is determined  for purposes of this Article as the mean
            of the high and low price on such date for  Tricon  Common  Stock as
            reported on the composite tape for securities listed on the New York
            Stock Exchange, Inc., rounded to four decimal places.

                              (2) If  shares of Tricon  Common  Stock  change by
            reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger,
            consolidation, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares, complete
            or partial  liquidation  or other  similar  corporate  change,  such
            equitable  adjustment shall be made in the number of shares credited
            to an Account or subaccount as the Plan  Administrator may determine
            to be necessary or appropriate.

      In no event will shares of Tricon  Common  Stock  actually be purchased or
      held  under  this  Plan,  and no  Participant  shall  have any rights as a
      shareholder of Tricon Common Stock on account of an interest in the Tricon
      Common Stock Account.

                  (c)  Investment  Reallocations.  In  accordance  with  Section
      4.1(e),   a  Tricon  Account  Holder  may  reallocate   amounts  from  his
      Subaccounts in the Tricon Common Stock Account to other phantom investment
      options under the Plan that are available for this purpose. No Participant
      may reallocate amounts into the Tricon Common Stock Account.

                  (c) Termination of the Tricon Common Stock Account.  Effective
      as of the end of the day on  December  31, 1998 (or such later date as the
      Plan Administrator  shall specify),  the Tricon Common Stock Account shall
      cease to be  available  under the Plan.  Any  amount  under the Plan still
      standing to the credit of a Participant  on such date shall  automatically
      be  reallocated  to the phantom  investment  option  described  in Section
      4.1(c)(1) (the Interest Bearing Account) unless the Participant  selects a
      different  replacement  option in accordance with such requirements as the
      Plan Administrator may apply.

            A.6 PepsiCo Account  Holders with Less Than 10 Shares:  The interest
in the PepsiCo  Capital Stock Account of any PepsiCo Account Holder who does not
qualify to be a Tricon Account  Holder shall be adjusted as of the  Distribution
Date.  Pursuant to this adjustment,  the value of his dividend  subaccount under
the PepsiCo  Capital  Stock Account shall be increased by the product of (a) and
(b) below:

                  (a) The number of phantom  shares of PepsiCo stock credited to
      the Participant's  Account under the PepsiCo Capital Stock Account divided
      by 10.

                  (b) The fair market value of a share of Tricon Common Stock on
      the Distribution Date.

                               ARTICLE I Foreword
            The  PepsiCo  Pension  Equalization  Plan ("PEP" or "Plan") has been
established  by PepsiCo  for the benefit of  salaried  employees  of the PepsiCo
Organization who participate in the PepsiCo Salaried  Employees  Retirement Plan
("Salaried  Plan").  PEP provides benefits for eligible  employees whose pension
benefits  under the Salaried Plan are limited by the  provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, PEP provides benefits for certain
eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula.
            This Plan  document  amends and restates in its entirety the Plan as
it was in effect prior to January 1, 1989, and conforms the terms of the Plan to
the  practices  of the  Company  on and after  that  date,  in  accordance  with
decisions by the  Company's  board of directors  in  November,  1989.  Except as
otherwise  provided  herein,  this amended and restated  Plan is effective as of
January 1, 1989 and  applies to  employees  who receive  Credited  Service on or
after that date.  The prior  provisions  of the Plan shall govern the rights and
benefits of other  employees  and shall govern for periods  before the effective
date of any provision with a different effective date.

            benefit to which a Participant  would be entitled at age 65 shall be
            based upon the following assumptions:
                              (i) That the  Participant's  social security wages
                    in any year prior to  Retirement  or severance  are equal to
                    the Taxable Wage Base in such year, and
                              (ii) That he will not receive any social  security
                    wages after Retirement or severance.
            However,  in computing a Vested  Pension  under Formula A of Section
            5.2,  the  estimate  of the  old-age  insurance  benefit  to which a
            Participant  would be  entitled  at age 65  shall be based  upon the
            assumption  that he continued to receive social security wages until
            age 65 at the same  rate as the  Taxable  Wage Base in effect at his
            severance from employment. For purposes of this subsection,  "social
            security  wages"  shall mean wages  within the meaning of the Social
            Security Act.
                        (2)  For  purposes  of  determining   the  amount  of  a
            Disability  Pension,  the Primary  Social  Security  Amount shall be
            (except as provided in the next sentence) the initial monthly amount
            actually  received  by  the  disabled  Participant  as a  disability
            insurance  benefit  under the  provisions  of Title II of the Social
            Security  Act,  as  amended  and  in  effect  at  the  time  of  the
            Participant's  retirement  due to  disability.  Notwithstanding  the
            preceding  sentence,  for any period that a  Participant  receives a
            Disability  Pension before receiving a disability  insurance benefit
            under the  provisions  of Title II of the Social  Security Act, then
            the  Participant's  Primary Social  Security  Amount for such period
            shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (1) above.
                        (3) For purposes of paragraphs  (1) and (2), the Primary
            Social  Security  Amount shall exclude amounts that may be available
            because of the spouse or any  dependent  of the  Participant  or any
            amounts payable on account of the Participant's death.  Estimates of
            Primary  Social  Security  Amounts shall be made on the basis of the
            Social Security Act as in effect at the Participant's Severance from
            Service Date, without regard to any increases in the social security
            wage base or benefit  levels  provided by such Act which take effect
            thereafter.
                    (ii) QUALIFIED JOINT AND SURVIVOR ANNUITY:  An Annuity which
      is  payable to the  Participant  for life with 50 percent of the amount of
      such  Annuity  payable  after  the  Participant's  death to his  surviving
      Eligible  Spouse  for  life.  If  the  Eligible  Spouse   predeceases  the
      Participant,  no survivor  benefit  under a Qualified  Joint and  Survivor
      Annuity  shall be payable  to any  person.  The amount of a  Participant's
      monthly  payment  under a Qualified  Joint and Survivor  Annuity  shall be
      reduced to the extent provided in sections 5.1 and 5.2, as applicable.
                    (jj) RETIREMENT: Termination of employment for reasons other
      than death after a Participant has fulfilled the requirements for either a
      Normal, Early, Late, or Disability Retirement Pension under Article IV.
                    (kk)  RETIREMENT  DATE:  The date on  which a  Participant's
      Retirement is considered  to commence.  Retirement  shall be considered to
      commence on the day immediately following: (i) a Participant's last day of
      employment,  or (ii) the last day of an  Authorized  Leave of Absence,  if
      later. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the case of a Disability
      Retirement  Pension,  Retirement  shall be considered as commencing on the
      Participant's  retirement  date  applicable  for such  purpose  under  the
      Salaried Plan.
                    (ll)  RETIREMENT PENSION:  The Pension payable to a

      Participant's total Pension in the form of a single payment.
                    (rr)  SOCIAL SECURITY ACT:  The Social Security Act of
      the  United  States,  as  amended,  an  enactment  providing  governmental
      benefits in connection  with events such as old age, death and disability.
      Any  reference  herein to the Social  Security Act (or any of the benefits
      provided  thereunder)  shall  be taken as a  reference  to any  comparable
      governmental  program  of  another  country,  as  determined  by the  Plan
      Administrator,  but only to the extent the Plan  Administrator  judges the
      computation of those benefits to be administratively feasible.
                    (ss)  TAXABLE WAGE BASE:  The contribution and benefit
      base (as determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act) in

      the singular may include the plural,  unless the context clearly indicates
      to the contrary.
                    (b)  Compounds  of the  Word  "Here":  The  words  "hereof",
      "hereunder" and other similar  compounds of the word "here" shall mean and
      refer to the entire Plan, not to any particular provision or section.
                    (c)  Examples:  Whenever  an example is provided or the text
      uses the term  "including"  followed by a specific item or items, or there
      is a passage having a similar  effect,  such passages of the Plan shall be
      construed as if the phrase "without  limitation"  followed such example or
      term (or otherwise  applied to such passage in a manner that avoids limits
      on its breadth of application).
                    (d) Subdivisions of the Plan Document: This Plan document is
      divided  and  subdivided  using  the  following   progression:   articles,

      subsection with the specified  designation contained in that same section.
      A similar rule shall apply with respect to paragraph  references  within a
      subsection and subparagraph references within a paragraph.

Retirement  Pension  determined in  accordance  with Section 4.4 of the Salaried
Plan (but without regard to any requirement for notice of suspension under ERISA
section  203(a)(3)(B)  or any adjustment as under Section 5.5(d) of the Salaried
Plan).  : A Participant  shall be eligible for a Disability  Pension if he meets
the  requirements  for a  Disability  Pension  under the  Salaried  Plan.  : Any

of the Eligible Spouse.
                    (a) Active, Disabled and Retired Employees: A Pre-Retirement
      Spouse's Pension shall be payable under this subsection to a Participant's
      Eligible  Spouse (if any) who is entitled  under the Salaried  Plan to the

      and retired  employees.  The amount of such Pension shall be determined in
      accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3.
                    (b) Vested  Employees:  A  Pre-Retirement  Spouse's  Pension
      shall be payable under this subsection to a Participant's  Eligible Spouse
      (if any) who is entitled  under the  Salaried  Plan to the  pre-retirement
      spouse's pension for survivors of vested terminated Employees.  The amount
      of such Pension shall be determined in accordance  with the  provisions of
      Section  5.3.  If  pursuant  to this  Section  4.6(b)  a  Participant  has
      Pre-Retirement  Spouse's  coverage in effect for his Eligible Spouse,  any
      Pension  calculated  for the  Participant  under  Section  5.2(b) shall be
      reduced  for each  year  such  coverage  is in  effect  by the  applicable
      percentage set forth below (based on the Participant's age at the time the
      coverage  is in effect)  with a pro rata  reduction  for any  portion of a
      year. No reduction  shall be made for coverage in effect within the 90-day
      period following a Participant's termination of employment.

the time specified in Section 6.1.
:           4.9  Cashout Distributions
                    (a)   Distribution  of  Participant's   Pension:   If  at  a
      Participant's  Annuity  Starting  Date the Actuarial  Equivalent  lump sum
      value of the  Participant's  PEP Pension is equal to or less than $10,000,
      the Plan  Administrator  shall distribute to the Participant such lump sum
      value of the Participant's PEP Pension.
                    (b) Distribution of Pre-Retirement Spouse's Pension Benefit:
      If at the time  payments  under the Salaried  Plan commence to an Eligible
      Spouse the Actuarial  Equivalent lump sum value of the PEP  Pre-Retirement
      Spouse's  Pension  to be paid is equal to or less than  $10,000,  the Plan
      Administrator  shall distribute to the Eligible Spouse such lump sum value
      of the PEP Pre-Retirement Spouse's Pension.
Any lump sum distributed under this section shall be in lieu of the Pension that
otherwise  would  be   distributable  to  the  Participant  or  Eligible  Spouse
hereunder.  : The terms of this  section  apply  notwithstanding  the  preceding
provisions of this  Article.  At any time prior to April 14, 1991, a Participant
shall not be eligible to receive a Normal,  Early,  Vested or Disability Pension
for any month or period of time for which he is  eligible  for,  and  receiving,
benefits under a long term disability plan maintained by an Employer. However, a
Participant's  Eligible  Spouse  shall not be  ineligible  for a  Pre-Retirement
Spouse's  Pension or  benefits  under a  Qualified  Joint and  Survivor  Annuity
because the Participant was receiving benefits under a long term disability plan
at the date of his death. : In the case of a current or former  Participant  who
is reemployed  and is eligible to  reparticipate  in the Salaried Plan after his
Annuity  Starting  Date,  payment of his Pension will be suspended if payment of
his Salaried Plan pension is suspended (or would have been if it were already in
pay status).  Thereafter,  his Pension shall  recommence at the time  determined
under Section 6.1 (even if the  suspension  of his Salaried Plan pension  ceases
earlier).

                     ARTICLE V Amount of Retirement Pension


            When a Pension becomes payable to or on behalf of a Participant
under this Plan, the amount of such Pension shall be determined under Section
5.1, 5.2 or 5.3 (whichever is applicable), subject to any adjustments
required under Sections 4.6(b), 5.4 and 5.5.
:           5.1  PEP Pension
                    (a) Same Form as Salaried Plan: If a  Participant's  Pension
      will be paid in the same form and will commence as of the same time as his
      pension under the Salaried Plan,  then his Pension  hereunder shall be the
      difference between:
                        (1) His Total Pension expressed in such form and payable
            as of such time, minus
                        (2) His Salaried Plan Pension expressed in such form and
            payable as of such time.
                    (b) Different  Form than Salaried  Plan: If a  Participant's
      Pension will be paid in a different  form (whether in whole or in part) or
      will  commence as of a different  time than his pension under the Salaried
      Plan, his Pension shall be the product of:
                        (1)  The  amount  of  the  Participant's  Total  Pension
            expressed  in the form and payable as of such time as applies to his
            Pension under this Plan, multiplied by
                        (2) A fraction,  the  numerator of which is the value of
            his Total Pension reduced by the value of his Salaried Plan Pension,
            and the denominator of which is the value of his Total Pension (with
            value  determined  on a  reasonable  and  consistent  basis,  in the
            discretion  of the Plan  Administrator,  with  respect to  similarly
            situated employees).
                    (c)  Definitions:   The  following   definitions  apply  for
      purposes of this section.
                        (1) A  Participant's  "Total  Pension" means the greater
            of:
                              (i)  The  amount  of  the  Participant's   pension
                    determined under the terms of the Salaried Plan, but without
                    regard  to:  (A)  the   limitations   imposed  by   sections
                    401(a)(17)  and 415 of the  Code (as  such  limitations  are
                    interpreted  and applied under the Salaried  Plan),  and (B)
                    the  actuarial   adjustment  under  Section  5.5(d)  of  the
                    Salaried Plan; or
                              (ii) The amount (if any) of the  Participant's PEP
                    Guarantee determined under Section 5.2.
            In making this  comparison,  the benefits in  subparagraphs  (i) and
            (ii) above shall be calculated  with  reference to the specific form
            and time of payment that is applicable.  If the  applicable  form of
            payment is a lump sum, the Actuarial  Equivalent  factors in Section
            2.1(b)(2)  shall apply for purposes of  subparagraph  (i) in lieu of
            those in the Salaried Plan.
                        (2) A  Participant's  "Salaried  Plan Pension" means the
            amount of the  Participant's  pension  determined under the terms of
            the Salaried Plan.
: A Participant who is eligible under  subsection (a) below shall be entitled to
a PEP Guarantee  benefit  determined  under subsection (b) below. In the case of
other Participants, the PEP Guarantee shall not apply.
                    (a)  Eligibility:  A  Participant  shall be  covered by this
      section if the Participant has 1988 pensionable  earnings from an Employer
      of at least  $75,000.  For  purposes of this  section,  "1988  pensionable
      earnings" means the Participant's remuneration for the 1988 calendar year,
      within  the  meaning  of the  Salaried  Plan as in effect  in 1988.  "1988
      pensionable  earnings"  does  not  include  remuneration  from  an  entity
      attributable to any period when that entity was not an Employer.
                    (b) PEP Guarantee Formula: The amount of a Participant's PEP
      Guarantee  shall be determined  under the applicable  formula in paragraph
      (1), subject to the special rules in paragraph (2).
                        (1)  Formulas:  The  amount of a  Participant's  Pension
            under  this  paragraph   shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with
            subparagraph  (i) below.  However,  if the  Participant was actively
            employed by the PepsiCo  Organization in a  classification  eligible
            for the  Salaried  Plan  prior to July 1,  1975,  the  amount of his
            Pension  under this  paragraph  shall be the  greater of the amounts
            determined  under   subparagraphs   (i)  and  (ii),   provided  that
            subparagraph  (ii)(B) shall not apply in determining the amount of a
            Vested Pension.
                              (i)  Formula  A: The  Pension  amount  under  this
                    subparagraph shall be:
                                    (A) 3 percent of the  Participant's  Highest
                        Average  Monthly  Earnings  for the  first  10  years of
                        Credited Service, plus
                                    (B) 1 percent of the  Participant's  Highest
                        Average  Monthly  Earnings  for  each  year of  Credited
                        Service in excess of 10 years, less
                                    (C)  1-2/3  percent  of  the   Participant's
                        Primary Social  Security  Amount  multiplied by years of
                        Credited Service not in excess of 30 years.
                  In  determining  the  amount of a Vested  Pension  under  this
                  Formula A, the Pension  shall first be calculated on the basis
                  of (I) the Credited Service the Participant  would have earned
                  had he remained in the employ of the Employer until his Normal
                  Retirement Age, and (II) his Highest Average Monthly  Earnings
                  and  Primary  Social  Security  Amount at his  Severance  from
                  Service  Date,  and then shall be reduced by  multiplying  the
                  resulting amount by a fraction,  the numerator of which is the
                  Participant's   actual  years  of  Credited   Service  on  his
                  Severance  from Service Date and the  denominator  of which is
                  the years of  Credited  Service  he would  have  earned had he
                  remained  in  the  employ  of an  Employer  until  his  Normal
                  Retirement Age.
                              (ii)  Formula  B: The  Pension  amount  under this
                    subparagraph shall be the greater of (A) or (B) below:
                                    (A) 1-1/2 percent of Highest Average Monthly
                        Earnings times the number of years of Credited  Service,
                        less 50  percent  of the  Participant's  Primary  Social
                        Security Amount, or
                                    (B) 3 percent  of  Highest  Average  Monthly
                        Earnings  times the number of years of Credited  Service
                        up to 15 years,  less 50  percent  of the  Participant's
                        Primary Social Security Amount.
            In determining the amount of a Disability Pension under Formula A or
            B  above,  the  Pension  shall  be  calculated  on the  basis of the
            Participant's   Credited  Service  (determined  in  accordance  with
            Section  3.3(d)(3) of the Salaried  Plan),  and his Highest  Average
            Monthly  Earnings and Primary Social  Security Amount at the date of
            disability.
                        (2)  Calculation:  The amount of the PEP Guarantee shall
            be  determined  pursuant  to  paragraph  (1)  above,  subject to the
            following special rules:
                              (i) Surviving  Eligible Spouse's Annuity:  Subject
                    to  subparagraph  (iii) below and the last  sentence of this
                    subparagraph, if the Participant has an Eligible Spouse, the
                    Participant's Eligible Spouse shall be entitled to receive a
                    survivor  annuity  equal to 50 percent of the  Participant's
                    Annuity under this section, with no corresponding  reduction
                    in such Annuity for the  Participant.  Annuity payments to a
                    surviving  Eligible  Spouse  shall begin on the first day of
                    the month  coincident  with or following  the  Participant's
                    death and shall end with the last monthly  payment due prior
                    to the Eligible  Spouse's  death.  If the Eligible Spouse is
                    more  than  10  years  younger  than  the  Participant,  the
                    survivor  benefit payable under this  subparagraph  shall be
                    adjusted as provided below.
                                    (A) For each full year more than 10 but less
                        than 21 that the  surviving  Eligible  Spouse is younger
                        than the  Participant,  the survivor  benefit payable to
                        such spouse shall be reduced by 0.8 percent.
                                    (B) For each full year more than 20 that the
                        surviving   Eligible   Spouse   is   younger   than  the
                        Participant, the survivor benefit payable to such spouse
                        shall be reduced by an additional 0.4 percent.
                              (ii)  Reductions:  The following  reductions shall
                        apply in determining a Participant's PEP Guarantee.
                                    (A) If the Participant will receive an Early
                        Retirement Pension,  the payment amount shall be reduced
                        by  3/12ths  of 1  percent  for each  month by which the
                        benefit   commencement   date   precedes  the  date  the
                        Participant would attain his Normal Retirement Date.
                                    (B)  If the  Participant  is  entitled  to a
                        Vested  Pension,  the payment amount shall be reduced to
                        the Actuarial  Equivalent  of the amount  payable at his
                        Normal Retirement Date (if payment commences before such
                        date),  and  the  Section  4.6(b)   reductions  for  any
                        Pre-Retirement Spouse's coverage shall apply.
                                    (C) This clause  applies if the  Participant
                        will  receive  his  Pension in a form that  provides  an
                        Eligible Spouse benefit,  continuing for the life of the
                        surviving  spouse,  that is greater  than that  provided
                        under   subparagraph   (i).   In  this   instance,   the
                        Participant's   Pension  under  this  section  shall  be
                        reduced so that the total value of the  benefit  payable
                        on the Participant's  behalf is the Actuarial Equivalent
                        of the Pension  otherwise  payable  under the  foregoing
                        provisions of this section.
                                    (D) This clause  applies if the  Participant
                        will  receive  his  Pension  in a form that  provides  a
                        survivor  annuity  for a  beneficiary  who  is  not  his
                        Eligible  Spouse.  In this instance,  the  Participant's
                        Pension  under this section shall be reduced so that the
                        total value of the benefit payable on the  Participant's
                        behalf  is the  Actuarial  Equivalent  of a Single  Life
                        Annuity for the Participant's life.
                                    (E) This clause  applies if the  Participant
                        will receive his Pension in a Annuity form that includes
                        inflation  protection  described in Section  6.2(b).  In
                        this  instance,  the  Participant's  Pension  under this
                        section  shall be reduced so that the total value of the
                        benefit  payable  on  the  Participant's  behalf  is the
                        Actuarial Equivalent of the elected Annuity without such
                        protection.
                              (iii)  Lump  Sum  Conversion:  The  amount  of the
                    Retirement  Pension  determined  under  this  section  for a
                    Participant whose Retirement  Pension will be distributed in
                    the form of a lump sum shall be the Actuarial  Equivalent of
                    the  Participant's  PEP  Guarantee   determined  under  this
                    section,  taking  into  account  the  value of any  survivor
                    benefit   under   subparagraph   (i)  above  and  any  early
                    retirement reductions under subparagraph (ii)(A) above.
: The  monthly  amount  of the  Pre-Retirement  Spouse's  Pension  payable  to a
surviving Eligible Spouse under Section 4.6 shall be determined under subsection
(a) below.
                    (a)  Calculation:  An Eligible Spouse's Pre-Retirement
      Spouse's Pension shall be the difference between:
                        (1)  The Eligible Spouse's Total Pre-Retirement
            Spouse's Pension, minus
                        (2)  The Eligible Spouse's Salaried Plan
            Pre-Retirement Spouse's Pension.
                    (b)  Definitions:   The  following   definitions  apply  for
      purposes of this section.
                        (1)  An Eligible Spouse's "Total Pre-Retirement
            Spouse's Pension" means the greater of:
                              (i)   The   amount   of  the   Eligible   Spouse's
                    pre-retirement  spouse's pension  determined under the terms
                    of the  Salaried  Plan,  but  without  regard  to:  (A)  the
                    limitations  imposed by sections  401(a)(17)  and 415 of the
                    Code (as such  limitations are interpreted and applied under
                    the Salaried Plan),  and (B) the actuarial  adjustment under
                    Section 5.5(d) of the Salaried Plan; or
                              (ii) The amount (if any) of the Eligible  Spouse's
                    PEP Guarantee  Pre-Retirement  Spouse's  Pension  determined
                    under
                    subsection (c).
            In making this  comparison,  the benefits in  subparagraphs  (i) and
            (ii) above shall be calculated  with  reference to the specific time
            of payment applicable to the Eligible Spouse.
                    (c)  PEP  Guarantee   Pre-Retirement  Spouse's  Pension:  An
      Eligible Spouse's PEP Guarantee  Pre-Retirement  Spouse's Pension shall be
      determined in  accordance  with  paragraph (1) or (2) below,  whichever is
      applicable, with reference to the PEP Guarantee (if any) that would
      have been available to the Participant under
      Section 5.2.
                        (1) Normal Rule:  The  Pre-Retirement  Spouse's  Pension
            payable under this paragraph shall be equal to the amount that would
            be  payable  as a  survivor  annuity,  under a  Qualified  Joint and
            Survivor Annuity, if the Participant had:
                              (i)  Separated  from  service on the date of death
                    (or, if earlier, his actual Severance from Service Date);
                              (ii)  Commenced  a  Qualified  Joint and  Survivor
                    Annuity  on  the  same  date   payments  of  the   Qualified
                    Pre-Retirement Spouse's Pension are to commence; and
                              (iii) Died on the day  immediately  following such
                    commencement.
            If payment of a Pre-Retirement Spouse's Pension under this paragraph
            commences prior to the date which would have been the  Participant's
            Normal   Retirement   Date,   appropriate   reductions   for   early
            commencement  shall be applied to the  Qualified  Joint and Survivor
            Annuity upon which the Pre-Retirement Spouse's Pension
            is based.
                        (2)  Special  Rule for  Active and  Disabled  Employees:
            Notwithstanding  paragraph (1) above,  the  Pre-Retirement  Spouse's
            Pension paid on behalf of a Participant  described in Section 4.6(a)
            shall  not be less  than  an  amount  equal  to 25  percent  of such
            Participant's  PEP Guarantee  determined under Section 5.2. For this
            purpose, Credited Service shall be determined as provided in Section
            3.3(d)(2)  of the  Salaried  Plan,  and the  deceased  Participant's
            Highest Average Monthly Earnings, Primary Social Security Amount and
            Covered  Compensation shall be determined as of his date of death. A
            Pre-Retirement  Spouse's Pension under this paragraph is not reduced
            for early commencement.
: Pensions  determined under the foregoing  sections of this Article are subject
to  adjustment  as  provided in this  section.  For  purposes  of this  section,
"specified  plan" shall mean the Salaried  Plan or a  nonqualified  pension plan
similar to this Plan. A nonqualified  pension plan is similar to this Plan if it
is sponsored by a member of the PepsiCo Organization and if its benefits are not
based on participant pay deferrals.
                    (a)  Adjustments for Rehired  Participants:  This subsection
      shall apply to a current or former Participant who is reemployed after his
      Annuity  Starting  Date and  whose  benefit  under  the  Salaried  Plan is
      recalculated  based on an additional  period of Credited  Service.  In the
      event of any such recalculation,  the Participant's PEP Pension shall also
      be  recalculated  hereunder.  For this purpose,  the PEP  Guarantee  under
      Section  5.2  is  adjusted   for   in-service   distributions   and  prior
      distributions  in the same  manner  as  benefits  are  adjusted  under the
      Salaried Plan, but by taking into account benefits under this Plan and any
      specified plans.
                    (b) Adjustment for Increased  Pension Under Other Plans:  If
      the benefit  paid under a  specified  plan on behalf of a  Participant  is
      increased after PEP benefits on his behalf have been  determined  (whether
      the  increase  is  by  order  of  a  court,   by  agreement  of  the  plan
      administrator  of the specified  plan, or otherwise),  the PEP benefit for
      the Participant shall be recalculated.  If the recalculation identifies an
      overpayment hereunder,  the Plan Administrator shall take such steps as it
      deems advisable to recover the  overpayment.  It is specifically  intended
      that there shall be no  duplication  of  payments  under this Plan and any
      specified plans.
: Effective  for periods of  employment  on or after June 30, 1997, an executive
classified as level 22 or above whose employment by an Employer is for a limited
duration assignment shall not become entitled to a benefit or to any increase in
benefits in connection with such employment.

                         ARTICLE VI Distribution Options


            The terms of this Article govern the  distribution  of benefits to a
Participant who becomes  entitled to payment of a Pension under the Plan. : This
section shall govern the form and timing of  distributions  of PEP Pensions that
begin on or after March 1, 1992. Plan  distributions that begin before that date
shall be governed by the prior terms of the Plan. The provisions of this Section
6.1 are in all cases subject to the cashout rules set forth in Section 4.9.
                    (a) No Advance  Election:  This subsection  shall apply to a
      Participant: (i) who does not have an Advance Election in effect as of the
      close of  business  on the day before  his  Retirement  Date,  or (ii) who
      terminates employment prior to Retirement. Subject to the next sentence, a
      Participant  described in this subsection shall be paid his PEP Pension in
      the same  form and at the same  time as he is paid his  Pension  under the
      Salaried  Plan. If a  Participant's  Salaried  Plan Annuity  Starting Date
      occurs while he is still an employee of the PepsiCo Organization  (because
      of the time of payment  provisions  in Code  section  401(a)(9)),  payment
      under the Plan shall not begin until the first of the month next following
      the Participant's  Severance from Service Date. In this instance, the form
      of payment under this Plan shall remain that applicable under the Salaried
      Plan.
                    (b) Advance Election in Effect:  This subsection shall apply
      to a  Participant:  (i) who has an  Advance  Election  in effect as of the
      close of business on the day before his  Retirement  Date,  and (ii) whose
      Retirement Date is after 1993. To be in effect,  an Advance  Election must
      meet the advance receipt and other requirements of Section 6.3(b).
                        (1) Lump Sum Election:  If a Participant covered by this
            subsection  has an Advance  Election to receive a Single Lump Sum in
            effect as of the close of business on the day before his  Retirement
            Date, the Participant's  Retirement  Pension under the Plan shall be
            paid as a Single  Lump Sum as of the first of the  month  coincident
            with or next following his Retirement Date.
                        (2) Annuity Election:  If a Participant  covered by this
            subsection  has an Advance  Election to receive an Annuity in effect
            as of the close of business on the day before his  Retirement  Date,
            the Participant's Retirement Pension under the Plan shall be paid in
            an Annuity  beginning on the first of the month  coincident  with or
            next following his Retirement Date. The following provisions of this
            paragraph  govern  the  form of  Annuity  payable  in the  case of a
            Participant described in this paragraph.
                              (i) Salaried Plan Election:  A Participant who has
                    a  qualifying  Salaried  Plan  election  shall  receive  his
                    distribution  in the same form of  Annuity  the  Participant
                    selected in such qualifying Salaried Plan election. For this
                    purpose, a "qualifying  Salaried Plan election" is a written
                    election of a form of payment by the  Participant  that: (A)
                    is currently  in effect  under the  Salaried  Plan as of the
                    close  of  business  on the  day  before  the  Participant's
                    Retirement Date, and (B) specifies an Annuity as the form of
                    payment  for  all or part  of the  Participant's  Retirement
                    Pension  under  the  Salaried  Plan.  For  purposes  of  the
                    preceding  sentence,  a Participant who elects a combination
                    lump sum and Annuity  under the Salaried  Plan is considered
                    to have  specified an Annuity for part of his Salaried  Plan
                    Pension.
                              (ii)  PEP  Election:  A  Participant  who  is  not
                    covered by  subparagraph  (i) and who has a PEP  Election in
                    effect as of the close of  business  on the day  before  his
                    Retirement  Date shall receive his  distribution in the form
                    of Annuity the Participant selects in such PEP Election.
                              (iii) No PEP Election:  A  Participant  who is not
                    covered by subparagraph  (i) or (ii) above shall receive his
                    distribution  in the form of a Qualified  Joint and Survivor
                    Annuity if he is  married,  or in the form of a Single  Life
                    Annuity  if  he  is  not  married.   For  purposes  of  this
                    subparagraph   (iii),  a  Participant  shall  be  considered
                    married if he is  married  on the day before his  Retirement
                    Date.
: The forms of payment set forth in  subsections  (a) and (b) may be provided to
any  Participant who is entitled to a Retirement  Pension.  The forms of payment
for other  Participants are set forth in subsection (c) below. The provisions of
this section are  effective  for Annuity  Starting  Dates after 1989 and earlier
distributions shall be governed by prior terms of the Plan.
                    (a)  Basic  Forms of  Payment:  A  Participant's  Retirement
      Pension shall be distributed in one of the forms of payment listed in this
      subsection.  The  particular  form of payment  applicable to a Participant
      shall be  determined  in  accordance  with  Section  6.1.  Payments  shall
      commence  on the date  specified  in Section 6.1 and shall end on the date
      specified in this subsection.
                        (1)  Single  Life  Annuity  Option:  A  Participant  may
            receive  his  Pension in the form of a Single  Life  Annuity,  which
            provides  monthly payments ending with the last payment due prior to
            his death.
                        (2)  Survivor  Options:  A  Participant  may receive his
            Pension in accordance with one of the following survivor options:
                              (i) 100 Percent Survivor  Option:  The Participant
                    shall  receive a reduced  Pension  payable for life,  ending
                    with the  last  monthly  payment  due  prior  to his  death.
                    Payments in the same reduced amount shall continue after the
                    Participant's  death to his beneficiary for life,  beginning
                    on the first day of the month  coincident  with or following
                    the  Participant's  death and ending  with the last  monthly
                    payment due prior to the beneficiary's death.
                              (ii) 75 Percent Survivor  Option:  The Participant
                    shall  receive a reduced  Pension  payable for life,  ending
                    with the  last  monthly  payment  due  prior  to his  death.
                    Payments in the amount of 75 percent of such reduced Pension
                    shall be  continued  after  the  Participant's  death to his
                    beneficiary  for  life,  beginning  on the  first day of the
                    month coincident with or following the  Participant's  death
                    and ending  with the last  monthly  payment due prior to the
                    beneficiary's death.
                              (iii) 50 Percent Survivor Option:  The Participant
                    shall  receive a reduced  Pension  payable for life,  ending
                    with the  last  monthly  payment  due  prior  to his  death.
                    Payments in the amount of 50 percent of such reduced Pension
                    shall be  continued  after  the  Participant's  death to his
                    beneficiary  for  life,  beginning  on the  first day of the
                    month coincident with or following the  Participant's  death
                    and ending  with the last  monthly  payment due prior to the
                    beneficiary's death. A 50 percent survivor option under this
                    paragraph shall be a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity if
                    the Participant's beneficiary is his Eligible Spouse.
                              (iv)  Ten  Years  Certain  and  Life  Option:  The
                    Participant  shall receive a reduced  Pension which shall be
                    payable  monthly for his  lifetime but for not less than 120
                    months. If the retired  Participant dies before 120 payments
                    have been made, the monthly Pension amount shall be paid for
                    the  remainder of the 120 month period to the  Participant's
                    primary  beneficiary  (or if  the  primary  beneficiary  has
                    predeceased the Participant,  the  Participant's  contingent
                    beneficiary).
                        (3) Single Lump Sum Payment  Option:  A Participant  may
            receive  payment  of his  Pension  in the form of a Single  Lump Sum
            payment.
                        (4)  Combination  Lump  Sum/Monthly  Benefit  Option:  A
            Participant  who does not have an  Advance  Election  in effect  may
            receive a portion of his Pension in the form of a lump sum  payment,
            and the remaining portion in the form of one of the monthly benefits
            described in  paragraphs  (1) and (2) above.  The Pension is divided
            between  the  two  forms  of  payment  based  on  the  whole  number
            percentages  designated  by the  Participant  on a form provided for
            this  purpose  by the Plan  Administrator.  For the  election  to be
            effective,  the  sum  of  the  two  percentages  designated  by  the
            Participant must equal 100 percent.
                              (i) The amount of the Pension  paid in the form of
                    a lump sum is determined by multiplying: (A) the amount that
                    would be payable  to the  Participant  as a Single  Lump Sum
                    payment if the Participant's  entire benefit were payable in
                    that form, by (B) the percentage  that the  Participant  has
                    designated for receipt in the form of a lump sum.
                              (ii) The amount of the Pension paid in the form of
                    a monthly  benefit is  determined  by  multiplying:  (A) the
                    amount of the monthly  benefit  elected by the  Participant,
                    determined  in  accordance  with  paragraph (1) or (2) above
                    (whichever   applies),   by  (B)  the  percentage  that  the
                    Participant  has  designated  for  receipt  in the form of a
                    monthly  benefit.  (b) Inflation  Protection:  The following
                    levels of
      inflation protection may be provided to any Participant who is entitled to
      a Retirement  Pension (except to the extent such Pension is paid as a lump
      sum).
                        (1) 5  Percent  Inflation  Protection:  A  Participant's
            monthly benefit shall be initially reduced,  but thereafter shall be
            increased  if  inflation  in the prior year  exceeds 5 percent.  The
            amount of the increase shall be the difference  between inflation in
            the prior year and 5 percent.
                        (2) 7  Percent  Inflation  Protection:  A  Participant's
            monthly benefit shall be initially reduced,  but thereafter shall be
            increased  if  inflation  in the prior year  exceeds 7 percent.  The
            amount of the increase shall be the difference  between inflation in
            the prior year and 7 percent.
      Benefits shall be subject to increase in accordance  with this  subsection
      each  January  1,  beginning  with the  second  January  1  following  the
      Participant's  Annuity Starting Date. The amount of inflation in the prior
      year shall be determined  based on inflation in the 12-month period ending
      on September 30 of such year,  with inflation  measured in the same manner
      as applies on the Effective Date for adjusting  Social  Security  benefits
      for changes in the cost of living.  Inflation protection that is in effect
      shall  carry  over  to  any  survivor  benefit  payable  on  behalf  of  a
      Participant,  and shall increase the otherwise applicable survivor benefit
      as provided  above.  Any election by a  Participant  to receive  inflation
      protection  shall be  irrevocable  by such  Participant  or his  surviving
      beneficiary.
                    (c)  Available  Options  for Vested  Benefits:  The forms of
      payment  available for a Participant with a Vested Pension are a Qualified
      Joint and  Survivor  Annuity  for married  Participants  and a Single Life
      Annuity for both married and unmarried  Participants.  The applicable form
      of payment shall be determined in accordance with Section 6.1(a).
:  This section sets forth the procedures for making Advance Elections and
PEP Elections.
                    (a) In  General:  To qualify as an Advance  Election  or PEP
      Election for purposes of Section 6.1, an election must be made in writing,
      on the form  designated by the Plan  Administrator,  and must be signed by
      the Participant.  These requirements also apply to any revocations of such
      elections. Spousal consent is not required for any election (or revocation
      of election) under the Plan.
                    (b) Advance Election:  To qualify as an Advance Election, an
      election  must be made on or after  July 15,  1993 and meet the  following
      requirements.
                        (1) Election:  The  Participant  shall  designate on the
            Advance  Election  form whether the  Participant  elects to take his
            Pension in the form of an Annuity or a Single Lump Sum.
                        (2) Receipt by Plan Administrator:  The Advance Election
            must be received by the Plan  Administrator  before the start of the
            calendar year containing the  Participant's  Retirement Date, and at
            least 6 months before that  Retirement  Date. An election that meets
            the  foregoing  requirements  shall  remain  effective  until  it is
            changed or revoked.
                        (3) Change or Revocation of Election: A Plan Participant
            may change an Advance  Election by filing a new Election  that meets
            the foregoing requirements. A Plan Participant may revoke an Advance
            Election  only by filing a  revocation  that is received by the Plan
            Administrator  before the start of the calendar year  containing the
            Plan  Participant's  Retirement  Date,  and at least 6 months before
            that Retirement Date.
      Any Advance Election by a Participant  shall be void if the Participant is
      not entitled to a Retirement Pension.
                    (c)  PEP  Election:  A PEP  Election  may  only be made by a
      Participant who has an Advance Election to receive an Annuity in effect at
      the time his PEP  Election  is  received  by the  Plan  Administrator.  In
      determining whether an Advance Election is in effect for this purpose, the
      advance receipt  requirement of subsection  (b)(2) shall be considered met
      if it will be met by the Participant's proposed Retirement Date.
                        (1) Election: The Participant shall designate on the PEP
            Election  form the Annuity form of benefit the  Participant  selects
            from those  described in Section 6.2,  including  the  Participant's
            choice of inflation  protection,  subject to the  provisions of this
            Article VI. The forms of payment  described in Section 6.2(a)(3) and
            (4) are not available pursuant to a PEP Election.
                        (2) Receipt by the Plan Administrator:  The PEP Election
            must be received by the Plan  Administrator  no earlier than 90 days
            before  the  Participant's  Retirement  Date,  and no later than the
            close of  business  on the day before the  Participant's  Retirement
            Date.  The  Participant  shall  furnish  proof  of  the  age  of his
            beneficiary  (including his Eligible Spouse if  applicable),  to the
            Plan  Administrator by the day before the  Participant's  Retirement
            Date,  for any form of  payment  which is subject  to  reduction  in
            accordance with subsection 6.2(c) above.
      A  Participant  may change his PEP Election by filing a new Election  with
      the  Plan  Administrator  that  meets  the  foregoing  requirements.   The
      Participant's PEP Election shall become effective at the close of business
      on the day before the Participant's Retirement Date. Any PEP Election by a
      Participant  shall be void if the  Participant  does  not have an  Advance
      Election in effect at such time.
                    (d) Elections Rules for Annuity Starting Dates: When amounts
      become payable to a Participant in accordance  with Article IV, they shall
      be payable as of the Participant's  Annuity Starting Date and the election
      procedures  (in this  section and Sections 6.1 and 6.5) shall apply to all
      of the  Participant's  unpaid  accruals as of such Annuity  Starting Date,
      with the following exception.  In the case of a Participant who is rehired
      after his initial Annuity Starting Date and who (i) is currently receiving
      an Annuity that remained in pay status upon rehire, or (ii) was previously
      paid a lump sum distribution (other than a cashout distribution  described
      in Section 4.9(a)), the Participant's subsequent Annuity Starting Date (as
      a result of his termination of reemployment),  and the election procedures
      at such subsequent  Annuity Starting Date, shall apply only to the portion
      of his benefit  that accrues  after his rehire.  Any prior  accruals  that
      remain to be paid as of the Participant's subsequent Annuity Starting Date
      shall continue to be payable in accordance  with the elections made at his
      initial Annuity Starting Date.
For purposes of this section, an election shall be treated as received on a
particular day if it is: (A) postmarked that day,  or (B) actually received
by the Plan Administrator on that day.  Delivery under clause (B) must be
made by the close of business, which time is to be determined by the Plan
Administrator.
:           6.4  Special Rules for Survivor Options
                    (a) Effect of Certain Deaths:  If a Participant  makes a PEP
      Election  for a form of payment  described  in Section  6.2(a)(2)  and the
      Participant  or his  beneficiary  (beneficiaries  in the  case of  Section
      6.2(a)(2)(iv))  dies  before  the  PEP  Election  becomes  effective,  the
      election  shall be  disregarded.  If the  Participant  dies after such PEP
      Election  becomes  effective but before his  Retirement  Pension  actually
      commences,  the election  shall be given effect and the amount  payable to
      his surviving  Eligible Spouse or other  beneficiary shall commence on the
      first day of the month  following  his death  (any back  payments  due the
      Participant shall be payable to his estate).  In the case of a Participant
      who has elected the form of payment described in Section 6.2(a)(2)(iv), if
      such  Participant  dies: (i) after the PEP Election has become  effective,
      (ii)  without a surviving  primary or  contingent  beneficiary,  and (iii)
      before  receiving  120  payments  under  the  form of  payment,  then  the
      remaining  payments  due under such form of  payment  shall be paid to the
      Participant's  estate.  If  payments  have  commenced  under  such form of
      payment to a  Participant's  primary or  contingent  beneficiary  and such
      beneficiary  dies  before  payments  are  completed,  then  the  remaining
      payments   due  under  such  form  of  payment   shall  be  paid  to  such
      beneficiary's estate.
                    (b) Nonspouse Beneficiaries:  If a Participant's beneficiary
      is not his Eligible Spouse, he may not elect:
                              (i) The 100 percent  survivor option  described in
                    Section  6.2(a)(2)(i)  if his nonspouse  beneficiary is more
                    than 10 years younger than he is, or
                              (ii) The 75 percent  survivor option  described in
                    Section  6.2(a)(2)(ii) if his nonspouse  beneficiary is more
                    than 19 years younger than he is.
: A Participant  who has elected to receive all or part of his pension in a form
of payment that includes a survivor  option shall  designate a  beneficiary  who
will be entitled to any amounts payable on his death.  Such designation shall be
made on a PEP  Election  Form or an  approved  election  form  filed  under  the
Salaried  Plan,  whichever is  applicable.  In the case of the  survivor  option
described in Section  6.2(a)(2)(iv),  the Participant  shall be entitled to name
both a primary beneficiary and a contingent beneficiary.  A Participant (whether
active or  former)  shall  have the right to  change or revoke  his  beneficiary
designation  at any time prior to when his  election is finally  effective.  The
designation of any beneficiary,  and any change or revocation thereof,  shall be
made in accordance with rules adopted by the Plan  Administrator.  A beneficiary
designation  shall  not be  effective  unless  and  until  filed  with  the Plan
Administrator.  If no beneficiary is properly  designated,  then a Participant's
election of a  survivor's  option  described in Section  6.2(a)(2)  shall not be
given effect.

                                      VII-3



                           ARTICLE VII Administration
: The Plan shall be administered by the Plan Administrator, which shall have the
authority  to  interpret  the  Plan  and  issue  such  regulations  as it  deems
appropriate. The Plan Administrator shall maintain Plan records and make benefit
calculations,  and may rely upon information  furnished it by the Participant in
writing,  including the Participant's  current mailing address,  age and marital
status. The Plan Administrator's  interpretations,  determinations,  regulations
and  calculations  shall  be  final  and  binding  on all  persons  and  parties
concerned.  The Company,  in its capacity as Plan  Administrator or in any other
capacity,  shall not be a fiduciary of the Plan and any restrictions  that apply
to a party in interest under section 406 of ERISA shall not apply to the Company
or otherwise under the Plan. : Whenever, in the Plan Administrator's  opinion, a
person  entitled  to receive  any  payment of a benefit or  installment  thereof
hereunder is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be
unable to manage his financial affairs, the Plan Administrator may make payments
to such person or to the legal representative of such person for his benefit, or
the Plan  Administrator  may apply the payment for the benefit of such person in
such manner as it considers  advisable.  Any payment of a benefit or installment
thereof in  accordance  with the  provisions of this section shall be a complete
discharge of any liability  for the making of such payment under the  provisions
of the Plan. : The Plan  Administrator  shall have the  exclusive  discretionary
authority  to construe  and to interpret  the Plan,  to decide all  questions of
eligibility  for benefits and to determine the amount of such benefits,  and its
decisions on such matters are final and conclusive. This discretionary authority
is intended to be absolute,  and in any case where the extent of this discretion
is in question,  the Plan Administrator is to be accorded the maximum discretion
possible.  Any exercise of this  discretionary  authority shall be reviewed by a
court,  arbitrator or other tribunal under the arbitrary and capricious standard
(i.e.,  the abuse of discretion  standard).  If, pursuant to this  discretionary
authority,  an  assertion  of  any  right  to a  benefit  by or on  behalf  of a
Participant   or   beneficiary   is  wholly  or  partially   denied,   the  Plan
Administrator,  or a party  designated by the Plan  Administrator,  will provide
such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the
Plan Administrator, a comprehensible written notice setting forth:
                    (a) The  specific  reason or reasons  for such  denial;  (b)
                    Specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on
      which the denial is based;
                    (c) A description of any additional  material or information
      necessary  for  the  claimant  to  submit  to  perfect  the  claim  and an
      explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
                    (d) A description of the Plan's claim review procedure.  The
      claim review  procedure is available upon written  request by the claimant
      to the Plan  Administrator,  or the designated party, within 60 days after
      receipt by the claimant of written notice of the denial of the claim,  and
      includes the right to examine  pertinent  documents  and submit issues and
      comments in writing to the Plan  Administrator,  or the designated  party.
      The  decision on review  will be made within 60 days after  receipt of the
      request for review,  unless circumstances warrant an extension of time not
      to exceed an additional 60 days,  and shall be in writing and drafted in a
      manner  calculated to be understood by the claimant,  and include specific
      reasons for the decision with  references to the specific Plan  provisions
      on which the decision is based.
If within a reasonable period of time after the Plan receives the claim asserted
by the Participant,  the Plan  Administrator,  or the designated party, fails to
provide a  comprehensible  written  notice  stating  that the claim is wholly or
partially denied and setting forth the information  described in (a) through (d)
above,  the claim shall be deemed denied.  Once the claim is deemed denied,  the
Participant  shall be  entitled  to the  claim  review  procedure  described  in
subsection  (d) above.  Such review  procedure  shall be available  upon written
request by the  claimant to the Plan  Administrator,  or the  designated  party,
within 60 days after the claim is deemed  denied.  Any claim under the Plan that
is  reviewed  by a court  shall be  reviewed  solely on the basis of the  record
before the Plan Administrator at the time it made its determination.  : Specific
references in the Plan to the Plan  Administrator's  discretion  shall create no
inference that the Plan  Administrator's  discretion in any other respect, or in
connection with any other provision, is less complete or broad.

                           ARTICLE VIII Miscellaneous
: Nothing  contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment
between  an  Employer  and any  Employee,  or as a right of any  Employee  to be
continued in the  employment of an Employer,  or as a limitation of the right of
an Employer to discharge any of its Employees, with or without cause. : Benefits
payable under the Plan or the right to receive  future  benefits  under the Plan
shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation,  alienation, sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment,  execution, or levy of any
kind, either voluntary or involuntary, and any attempt to anticipate,  alienate,
sell, transfer,  assign,  pledge,  encumber,  charge or otherwise dispose of any
right to benefits payable  hereunder,  including any assignment or alienation in
connection  with a divorce,  separation,  child support or similar  arrangement,
shall be null and void and not binding on the Company.  The Company shall not in
any manner be liable  for,  or subject  to, the debts,  contracts,  liabilities,
engagements  or  torts of any  person  entitled  to  benefits  hereunder.  : The
Company's  obligations under the Plan shall not be funded,  but shall constitute
liabilities by the Company payable when due out of the Company's  general funds.
To the extent the  Participant  or any other person  acquires a right to receive
benefits under this Plan,  such right shall be no greater than the rights of any
unsecured  general  creditor of the Company.  : Any action by the Company  under
this  Plan  may be made by the  Board  of  Directors  of the  Company  or by the
Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors,  with a report of any actions
taken by it to the Board of Directors.  In addition,  such action may be made by
any other person or persons duly  authorized by resolution of said Board to take
such  action.  : Unless the Board of Directors  of the Company  shall  determine
otherwise, the Company shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any
employee acting in good faith within the scope of his employment in carrying out
the administration of the Plan.


<PAGE>





                      ARTICLE IX Amendment and Termination
: While the Company and the Employers intend to continue the Plan  indefinitely,
they assume no contractual obligation as to its continuance.  In accordance with
Section 8.4, the Company hereby reserves the right, in its sole  discretion,  to
amend, terminate, or partially terminate the Plan at any time provided, however,
that no such  amendment  or  termination  shall  adversely  affect the amount of
benefit to which a Participant  or his  beneficiary is entitled under Article IV
on the date of such amendment or  termination,  unless the  Participant  becomes
entitled  to an amount  equal to such  benefit  under  another  plan or practice
adopted by the Company.  Specific  forms of payment are not protected  under the
preceding  sentence.  : The  Company  may,  in its  sole  discretion,  make  any
amendment  or  amendments  to this  Plan  from  time to  time,  with or  without
retroactive effect, including any amendment or amendments to eliminate available
distribution  options  under Article VI hereof at any time before the earlier of
the  Participant's  Annuity  Starting Date under this Plan or under the Salaried
Plan. An Employer (other than the Company) shall not have the right to amend the
Plan. : The Company may terminate the Plan, either as to its participation or as
to the  participation  of one or more Employers.  If the Plan is terminated with
respect to fewer than all of the  Employers,  the Plan shall  continue in effect
for the benefit of the Employees of the remaining Employers.

                        ARTICLE  X  ERISA  Plan  Structure  This  Plan  document
            encompasses three separate plans within the
meaning  of  ERISA,  as are set  forth in  subsections  (a),  (b) and (c).  This
division into separate  plans shall be effective as of July 1, 1996;  previously
the plans set forth in  subsections  (b) and (c) were a single  plan  within the
meaning of ERISA.
                    (a) Excess  Benefit Plan: An excess  benefit plan within the
      meaning of section  3(36) of ERISA,  maintained  solely for the purpose of
      providing  benefits  for  Salaried  Plan  participants  in  excess  of the
      limitations on benefits imposed by section 415 of the Code.
                    (b) Excess  Compensation High Hat Plan: A plan maintained by
      the Company primarily for the purpose of providing  deferred  compensation
      for a select group of management or highly  compensated  employees  within
      the meaning of sections  201(2) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.  The plan provides
      benefits  for  Salaried  Plan  participants  in excess of the  limitations
      imposed by section  401(a)(17) of the Code on benefits  under the Salaried
      Plan (after  taking into  account any  benefits  under the excess  benefit
      plan). For ERISA reporting  purposes,  this portion of PEP may be referred
      to as the PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan I.
                    (c)  Grandfather  High Hat Plan:  A plan  maintained  by the
      Company primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a
      select group of  management  or highly  compensated  employees  within the
      meaning of  sections  201(2) and  401(a)(1)  of ERISA.  The plan  provides
      grandfather  benefits to those  Salaried  Plan  participants  described in
      section  5.2(a)  hereof,  by  preserving  for them the  pre-1989  level of
      benefit  accrual that was in effect before the Salaried  Plan's  amendment
      effective  January 1, 1989 (after  taking into account any benefits  under
      the excess benefit plan and excess  compensation high hat plan). For ERISA
      reporting  purposes,  this  portion  of PEP  shall be  referred  to as the
      PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan II.
Benefits under this Plan shall be allocated first to the excess benefit plan, to
the extent of benefits  paid for the purpose  indicated  in (a) above;  then any
remaining benefits shall be allocated to the excess  compensation high hat plan,
to the extent of benefits paid for the purpose  indicated in (b) above; then any
remaining  benefits shall be allocated to the grandfather  high hat plan.  These
three plans are severable for any and all purposes as directed by the Company.

            All questions pertaining to the construction, validity and effect of
the Plan shall be determined in accordance  with the provisions of ERISA. In the
event ERISA is not  applicable  or does not preempt  state law,  the laws of the
state of New York shall govern.
            If any  provision of this Plan is, or is  hereafter  declared to be,
void, voidable,  invalid or otherwise unlawful,  the remainder of the Plan shall
not be affected thereby.

                                    Foreword


            This  Appendix  sets  forth  additional   provisions  applicable  to
individuals  specified in the Articles of this Appendix. In any case where there
is a conflict  between the Appendix and the main text of the Plan,  the Appendix
shall govern.

                                       A-3

                                    ARTICLE A
                           Accruals for 1993 and 1994
            This  Article A of the  Appendix  shall be effective on the date the
Plan is adopted.
            A.1  Accruals  for 1993 and 1994:  This  section  shall apply to any
individual:  (i) who is a Salaried Plan  Participant and employed by the PepsiCo
Organization  on December 31, 1993,  (ii) whose  Salaried Plan Pension is vested
during 1993 (or would become vested in 1994 if his Service  included the assumed
period of continued service specified in (a)(1) below),  and (iii) whose minimum
1993 Pension in subsection  (a) below is not derived solely from that portion of
the Plan  described in (c) of Article X. In  determining  the amount of the 1993
and 1994 Pension  amounts for any such  individual,  the provisions set forth in
subsections (a) and (b) below shall apply.
                    (a) Minimum 1993 Pension:  Any  individual who is covered by
      this section  shall accrue a minimum 1993 Pension as of December 31, 1993.
      In determining the amount of such individual's  minimum 1993 Pension,  the
      following shall apply.
                        (1) An individual's  Service and Credited  Service as of
            the end of 1993 shall be assumed to equal the respective Service and
            Credited  Service he would  have if his  Service  continued  through
            December 31,  1994.  Notwithstanding  the  preceding  sentence,  the
            assumed period of continued  Service shall be less to the extent the
            Corporation's  human resource records on December 31, 1993 reflect a
            scheduled  termination  date in 1994  for such  individual.  In this
            case, the individual's  assumed period of continued service shall be
            the portion of 1994 that ends with such scheduled termination date.
                        (2) An individual's  Highest Average Monthly Earnings as
            of the end of 1993 shall be adjusted by the  actuary's  salary scale
            assumption which is used under the Salaried Plan, so that they equal
            the amount such scale  projects for the  individual as of the end of
            1994.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the following special
            rules shall apply.
                              (i) A higher salary scale assumption shall be used
                    for anyone whose projected 1994 earnings as reflected on the
                    "Special   PEP  Salary   Scale"  of  the  PepsiCo   Benefits
                    Department  on  December  31,  1993 are higher than would be
                    assumed under the first sentence of this paragraph.  In this
                    case, the individual's 1993 earnings shall be adjusted using
                    such higher salary scale.
                              (ii) In the case of an  individual  whose  assumed
                    period of service under paragraph (1) above is less than all
                    of  1994,   the  salary   adjustment   under  the  preceding
                    provisions of this paragraph  shall be reduced to the amount
                    that would apply if the individual had no earnings after his
                    scheduled termination date.
                        (3) An  individual's  attained age as of the end of 1993
            shall  be  assumed  to be the  age he  would  have at the end of the
            assumed period of continued  service  applicable under paragraph (1)
            above.
      Any  individual  who is covered by this section,  and who is not otherwise
      vested as of December  31,  1993,  shall be vested as of such date in both
      his Pension (determined without regard to this subsection) and his minimum
      1993 Pension.  For purposes of this  subsection,  Code section  401(a)(17)
      shall be applied in 1993 by giving  effect to the  amendments to such Code
      section made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Amendments of 1993.
                    (b)  Determination of 1994 Accrual:  If a participant in the
      Salaried Plan accrues a minimum 1993 Pension under  subsection  (a) above,
      the  amount of any PEP  Pension  for 1994 that  accrues  shall be only the
      amount by which the PEP  Pension  that  would  otherwise  accrue  for 1994
      exceeds his minimum 1993 Pension under subsection (a).
